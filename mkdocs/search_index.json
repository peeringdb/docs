It defines the database schema to create a local database copy.  The library is easy to integrate into a common framework for local tools and custom interfaces, and also supports multiple database engines (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite).\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeeringdb-py\n is a Python client for PeeringDB.

If peering is desired between two networks, and you're happy to just configure sessions without a commercial agreement, Pinder acts as the middle man.  You can submit the request via either a basic web UI or an API, and the other network is notified or can periodically check their outstanding requests.  If both network agree to peer, they are notified to configure a session.  Once both networks indicate that sessions are configured and established, the request is then deleted. \nA brief slide deck\n explains the functionality in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta development and reporting issues\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nPeeringDB beta server\n is running the latest beta software version, with full access over HTTP and the API.

New Issues  Evaluate if it's actually an issue, ask for feedback, etc, once it is determined valid, move it to  Icebox  and label it either bug or enhancement. Moving from New to  Icebox  probably doesn't need much discussion, it's quite easy to move back or mark as \"wontfix\" later. If anyone looks at an issue and it seems legit, move to  Icebox  for discussion. If it's a bug, try to reproduce it, if you can't, comment and ask for more information and leave in new.  Once, with a developer involved, it's decided no more information is needed to be able to fix/implement it, it can move to  Backlog , with a rough estimate.  Backlog  should be ordered with more important higher in the list.  Sprint  is the column that's next in the pipeline, which is everything that is approved to work on, so development starts immediately. This would be decided by the Product Committee.  All other PeeringDB projects should go through this issue board since we have to decide priority. For example, when something for peeringdb-py goes into a sprint, we'll make an issue on the peeringdb-py project, and pull it into that board.  Done  means completed in development, and will be pushed to beta for review. Issues are not  Closed  until they're deployed to production.",
