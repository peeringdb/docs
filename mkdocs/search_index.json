It defines the database schema to create a local database copy.  The library is easy to integrate into a common framework for local tools and custom interfaces, and also supports multiple database engines (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nIsolario project\n improve knowledge about the AS-level ecosystem of the Internet by increasing the amount of Autonomous Systems (ASes) from which BGP data is collected. Isolario offers network operators services based on the real-time analysis of inter-domain routing from different points of view in return for full routing tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIxgen\n is yet another open source, multiplatform peering configuration generator that is based on the PeeringDB API.  It can also run its own server for faster results.  Ixgen is configured using an INI- or JSON-style format, and produces custom template-driven or fixed JSON-style configurations,\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeeringdb-py\n is a Python client for PeeringDB.  It features functions to get objects and display them in JSON or YAML format, and provides a whois-like display of records.  The client also has an integrated local database sync, and provides a Python library for integration with custom tools.  \nSome examples\n are available too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinder\n is a tool that facilitates peering.  If peering is desired between two networks, and you're happy to just configure sessions without a commercial agreement, Pinder acts as the middle man.  You can submit the request via either a basic web UI or an API, and the other network is notified or can periodically check their outstanding requests.  If both network agree to peer, they are notified to configure a session.  Once both networks indicate that sessions are configured and established, the request is then deleted. \nA brief slide deck\n explains the functionality in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraceMON\n is a tool for visualizing a network topology generated by traceroutes that provides one-click access to IXP and network information.  It also displays PeeringDB information and allows the user to update their record.  RIPE Atlas users can access it by selecting a \ntraceroute measurement\n and clicking on the TraceMON tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Source\n\n\nSource code audit\n\n\nPeeringDB commissioned a full audit of PeeringDB's source code in 2018. \nComputest\n (the auditor) prepared a \nThird Pary Memo\n, this memo provides a high level overview of the outcome of the source code audit. The report is available \nhere\n.\n\n\nBeta development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nPeeringDB beta server\n is running the latest beta software version, with full access over HTTP and the API.  Note that changes made to the beta database are local to the beta server only, and are not reflected on the production servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nlatest changes to PeeringDB\n automagically redirects to the list of issues on PeeringDB's GitHub repository that document all of the changes in the current beta version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThank you!\n\n\nTranslators\n\n\npt\n\n\n\n\nRobert Philips (NTT Communications)\n\n\nLigio Gomes (NTT Communications)\n\n\n\n\nHistorical data\n\n\n\n\nThe PeeringDB 1.0 MySQL interface is gone.  The last available MySQL dump is archived at \nhttps://www.peeringdb.com/v1/final_export.sql\n.\n\n\nMySQL dumps from July, 29 2010 to March 14, 2016 are archived by CAIDA at \nhttp://data.caida.org/datasets/peeringdb-v1/\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow you can help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your entries and make sure everything looks correct\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPort any scripts to the new API\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend us feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove these docs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd or improve a \ntranslation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your feedback, we look forward to hearing from you!",

The product committee will select their own Chair and Vice chair by simple majority vote. The Board may add or remove members at any time it deems necessary.\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\n\nQuestions and suggestions for the Product Committee can be sent to \n\n\nKey development communication and community input gathering efforts will be conducted via the PeeringDB Governance Mailinglist \npdb-gov@lists.peeringdb.com\n\n\nAll issues and the product roadmap and feature backlog can be found at \nhttps://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues\n\n\n\n\nDecision Policy\n\n\nProduct Committee members will decide by simple majority vote on contested issues called by the Product Committee Chair.\n\n\n\n\nWorkflow\n\n\nDiagram of Workflow\n\n\nThe development roadmap is tracked using GitHub issues located at \nhttps://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues\n with the \nZenHub\n overlay.\n\n\nAll members of the Product Committee take part in a \nHot Seat\n schedule with a weekly rotation in order to monitor incoming github issues and ensure the follow-up of existing issues until they are either closed as non-implemented or moved to the backlog. \n\n\nNew Issues\n are evaluated to confirm they are legitimate, which may require asking the reporter for feedback. Issues that cannot be reproduced or where the solution is unclear are moved to \nReview\n. Moving from \nNew Issues\n to \nBacklog\n does not need much discussion as it is easy to move the issue back or mark it as \nwontfix\n later.\n\n\nOnce an issue is determined to be valid and coherent with the product vision, it is moved to \nBacklog\n and labeled as either bug or enhancement. If the issue is considered not to be coherent with the product vision, it will be marked as \nwontfix\n; the requester always has the option to forward his issue to the PeeringDB board if she disagrees with the assessment by the Product Committee.\n\nIf an issue is labeled as a bug, the severity will determine how it will be resolved. P1/P2 bugs are considered service impacting and will be treated by the software vendor under the maintenance agreement, P3/P4 bugs will be treated as product enhancement requests.\n\n\nEvery member of the Product Committee may label one issue a month as \nPC Candidate\n. An issues labeled as \nPC Candidate\n must have a solution for development fully specified within the Github issue before it can be considered for implementation. Once it is agreed with the developer that no more information is needed to be able to fix/implement an issue, it can be proposed for inclusion in the next sprint to the Product Committee mailing-list. The Product Committee (Vice) Chair will move the agreed upon issues to the \nSprint\n column.\n\n\nDepending on the effort required to implement the issue, development will be done either on project basis or as part of the maintenance agreement. The Product Committee follows a budget release process to fund project based development efforts. Developments that fall within the budget envelope allocated to the Product Committee require no further approval by the board, however 75% of the Product Committee members must agree. \n\n\nSprint\n is the column that is next in the pipeline, encompassing everything that is approved to work on, so development starts immediately. This would be decided by the Product Committee.\n\n\nAll other PeeringDB projects also go through this issue board to decide on priority. For example, when something for peeringdb-py goes into a sprint, an issue will be made on the peeringdb-py project and accessed by the main board.\n\n\nDone\n means the issue is completed in development and will be pushed to beta for review. Issues are not \nClosed\n until they are deployed to production\n\n\nMeeting Notes\n\n\n\n\nMarch 21st, 2017: Meeting Notes\n\n\nApril 13th, 2017: Meeting Notes\n\n\nJune 1st, 2017: Meeting Notes\n\n\nJuly 6th, 2017: Meeting Notes\n\n\nAugust 3rd, 2017: Meeting Notes\n\n\nOctober 12th, 2017: Meeting Notes\n\n\nDecember 7th, 2017: Meeting Notes\n\n\nJanuary 4th, 2018: Meeting Notes\n\n\nMarch 14th, 2018: Meeting Notes\n\n\nApril 5th, 2018: Meeting Notes\n\n\nJune 7th, 2018: Meeting Notes\n\n\n\n\nMembers\n\n\n\n\nEric Loos (Chair)\n\n\nMatt Griswold (Vice Chair)\n\n\nSamer Abdel-Hafez\n\n\nKarthik Arumugham\n\n\nFlorian Hibler\n\n\nAaron Hughes\n\n\nMartin J.

            "text": "Diagram of Workflow  The development roadmap is tracked using GitHub issues located at  https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues  with the  ZenHub  overlay.  All members of the Product Committee take part in a  Hot Seat  schedule with a weekly rotation in order to monitor incoming github issues and ensure the follow-up of existing issues until they are either closed as non-implemented or moved to the backlog.   New Issues  are evaluated to confirm they are legitimate, which may require asking the reporter for feedback. Issues that cannot be reproduced or where the solution is unclear are moved to  Review . Moving from  New Issues  to  Backlog  does not need much discussion as it is easy to move the issue back or mark it as  wontfix  later.  Once an issue is determined to be valid and coherent with the product vision, it is moved to  Backlog  and labeled as either bug or enhancement. If the issue is considered not to be coherent with the product vision, it will be marked as  wontfix ; the requester always has the option to forward his issue to the PeeringDB board if she disagrees with the assessment by the Product Committee. \nIf an issue is labeled as a bug, the severity will determine how it will be resolved. P1/P2 bugs are considered service impacting and will be treated by the software vendor under the maintenance agreement, P3/P4 bugs will be treated as product enhancement requests.  Every member of the Product Committee may label one issue a month as  PC Candidate . An issues labeled as  PC Candidate  must have a solution for development fully specified within the Github issue before it can be considered for implementation. Once it is agreed with the developer that no more information is needed to be able to fix/implement an issue, it can be proposed for inclusion in the next sprint to the Product Committee mailing-list. The Product Committee (Vice) Chair will move the agreed upon issues to the  Sprint  column.  Depending on the effort required to implement the issue, development will be done either on project basis or as part of the maintenance agreement. The Product Committee follows a budget release process to fund project based development efforts. Developments that fall within the budget envelope allocated to the Product Committee require no further approval by the board, however 75% of the Product Committee members must agree.   Sprint  is the column that is next in the pipeline, encompassing everything that is approved to work on, so development starts immediately. This would be decided by the Product Committee.  All other PeeringDB projects also go through this issue board to decide on priority. For example, when something for peeringdb-py goes into a sprint, an issue will be made on the peeringdb-py project and accessed by the main board.  Done  means the issue is completed in development and will be pushed to beta for review. Issues are not  Closed  until they are deployed to production",

PeeringDB will let you see information about Networks you might want to peer with, where and how you can peer with them, as well as publish information about your own Organization's peering information.\n\n\nHow do I get started?\n\n\nSee our Quick Start guide: \nhttp://docs.peeringdb.com/#quick-start\n\n\nTechnical\n\n\nHow do I query by ASN?\n\n\nYou may type in the ASN in the search box, or for web:\n\n\nhttp://as42.peeringdb.com\n\n\nhttps://peeringdb.com/net?asn=42\n\n\nFor API:\n\n\nhttps://peeringdb.com/api/net?asn=42\n\n\nUsing /asn used to work, what happened?\n\n\nPlease see \nhttp://lists.peeringdb.com/pipermail/pdb-announce/2016-March/000036.html\n for details.\n\n\nHow do the new permissions work?\n\n\nNow there is an \norg\n entity which owns the records.  A record can be a facility, an exchange point, or a network.  Users are added to the org entity and can then be given access to any facility, any network, any exchange point, or anything the org itself owns.\n\n\nAuthenticating via embedded user/pass in the URL\n\n\nSupport for this depends on the client and some browsers have stopped supporting embedded\n\nauthentication in the URL\n\n\nSo for example \n\n\nhttps://\nusername\n:\npassword\n@peeringdb.com/api/net/1\n\n\n\nmay work or it may not depending on the browser you are using.\n\n\nWhy are dates represented as strings in the API?\n\n\nDate strings are ISO 8601 to keep a standard format. Comparison operations such as \n__gt\n, \n__lt\n, etc all still work as expected. For fetching records against updated timestamp, you may also use \n?since=\nseconds since epoch\n\n\nHow do I sync the whole database to my local machine?\n\n\nYou may make a full local copy with \nhttps://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb-py\n, see docs at \nhttp://peeringdb.github.io/peeringdb-py/cli/\n\n\nInitially it will perform full sync, then it will only do an incremental sync (only updates records that have changed), so you're free to run it as often as you want.\n\n\nWhen syncing to MySQL I get 'Illegal mix of collations'\n\n\nSuch as:\n\n\ndjango.db.utils.OperationalError: (1267, \"Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8_general_ci,COERCIBLE) for operation '='\")\n\n\n\nWe will fix that when time allows, for the time being, just run:\n\n\nalter database peeringdb default character set utf8 default collate utf8_unicode_ci;\n\n\n\nGovernance/Membership\n\n\nHow does one become a PeeringDB member?\n\n\nYour organization does not need to be a Member to have an active account at PeeringDB.com, but Membership is available to those that do. Per the Bylaws, Membership is determined by having an active PeeringDB.com account, and a subscription to the \npdb-gov\n mailing list.\n\n\nWhat are the Terms and Conditions for PeeringDB membership?\n\n\nPlease see \nhttp://docs.peeringdb.com/gov/#organizational-documents\n for the legal aspects of PeeringDB. The Acceptable Use Policy is at \nhttps://peeringdb.com/aup\n.\n\n\nAre there any membership fees required for members?\n\n\nNo, there are no membership fees required. The organization welcomes sponsorships as its method of financial support. Please see \nhttps://www.peeringdb.com/sponsors\n for more information on supporting the PeeringDB.\n\n\nAre there any liabilities imposed on members?\n\n\nNo, there are not.\n\n\nTo register network information in the PeeringDB, is an organization required to join as a member?\n\n\nNo, that isn't necessary.",
