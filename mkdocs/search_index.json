It defines the database schema to create a local database copy.  The library is easy to integrate into a common framework for local tools and custom interfaces, and also supports multiple database engines (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIxgen\n is yet another open source, multiplatform peering configuration generator that is based on the PeeringDB API.  It can also run its own server for faster results.  Ixgen is configured using an INI- or JSON-style format, and produces custom template-driven or fixed JSON-style configurations,\n\n\n\n\n\n\npeeringdb-py\n is a Python client for PeeringDB.  It features functions to get objects and display them in JSON or YAML format, and provides a whois-like display of records.  The client also has an integrated local database sync, and provides a Python library for integration with custom tools.  \nSome examples\n are available too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinder\n is a tool that facilitates peering.  If peering is desired between two networks, and you're happy to just configure sessions without a commercial agreement, Pinder acts as the middle man.  You can submit the request via either a basic web UI or an API, and the other network is notified or can periodically check their outstanding requests.  If both network agree to peer, they are notified to configure a session.  Once both networks indicate that sessions are configured and established, the request is then deleted. \nA brief slide deck\n explains the functionality in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraceMON\n is a tool for visualizing a network topology generated by traceroutes that provides one-click access to IXP and network information.  It also displays PeeringDB information and allows the user to update their record.  RIPE Atlas users can access it by selecting a \ntraceroute measurement\n and clicking on the TraceMON tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeta development\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nPeeringDB beta server\n is running the latest beta software version, with full access over HTTP and the API.  Note that changes made to the beta database are local to the beta server only, and are not reflected on the production servers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nlatest changes to PeeringDB\n automagically redirects to the list of issues on PeeringDB's GitHub repository that document all of the changes in the current beta version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical data\n\n\n\n\nThe PeeringDB 1.0 MySQL interface is gone.  The last available MySQL dump is archived at \nhttps://www.peeringdb.com/v1/final_export.sql\n.\n\n\nMySQL dumps from July, 29 2010 to March 14, 2016 are archived by CAIDA at \nhttp://data.caida.org/datasets/peeringdb-v1/\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow you can help\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your entries and make sure everything looks correct\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPort any scripts to the new API\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend us feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprove these docs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for your feedback, we look forward to hearing from you!",

            "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\nWhat is the PeeringDB?\n\n\nIt's a database for peering and peering related information. PeeringDB will let you see information about Networks you might want to peer with, where and how you can peer with them, as well as publish information about your own Organization's peering information.\n\n\nHow do I get started?\n\n\nSee our Quick Start guide: \nhttp://docs.peeringdb.com/#quick-start\n\n\nTechnical\n\n\nHow do I query by ASN?\n\n\nYou may type in the ASN in the search box, or for web:\n\n\nhttp://as42.peeringdb.com\n\n\nhttps://peeringdb.com/net?asn=42\n\n\nFor API:\n\n\nhttps://peeringdb.com/api/net?asn=42\n\n\nUsing /asn used to work, what happened?\n\n\nPlease see \nhttp://lists.peeringdb.com/pipermail/pdb-announce/2016-March/000036.html\n for details.\n\n\nHow do the new permissions work?\n\n\nNow there is an \norg\n entity which owns the records.  A record can be a facility, an exchange point, or a network.  Users are added to the org entity and can then be given access to any facility, any network, any exchange point, or anything the org itself owns.\n\n\nAuthenticating via embedded user/pass in the URL\n\n\nSupport for this depends on the client and some browsers have stopped supporting embedded\n\nauthentication in the URL\n\n\nSo for example \n\n\nhttps://\nusername\n:\npassword\n@peeringdb.com/api/net/1\n\n\n\nmay work or it may not depending on the browser you are using.\n\n\nWhy are dates represented as strings in the API?\n\n\nDate strings are ISO 8601 to keep a standard format. Comparison operations such as \n__gt\n, \n__lt\n, etc all still work as expected. For fetching records against updated timestamp, you may also use \n?since=\nseconds since epoch\n\n\nHow do I sync the whole database to my local machine?\n\n\nYou may make a full local copy with \nhttps://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb-py\n, see docs at \nhttp://peeringdb.github.io/peeringdb-py/cli/\n\n\nInitially it will perform full sync, then it will only do an incremental sync (only updates records that have changed), so you're free to run it as often as you want.\n\n\nWhen syncing to MySQL I get 'Illegal mix of collations'\n\n\nSuch as:\n\n\ndjango.db.utils.OperationalError: (1267, \"Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8_general_ci,COERCIBLE) for operation '='\")\n\n\n\nWe will fix that when time allows, for the time being, just run:\n\n\nalter database peeringdb default character set utf8 default collate utf8_unicode_ci;\n\n\n\nGovernance/Membership\n\n\nHow does one become a PeeringDB member?\n\n\nYour organization does not need to be a Member to have an active account at PeeringDB.com, but Membership is available to those that do. Per the Bylaws, Membership is determined by having an active PeeringDB.com account, and a subscription to the \npdb-gov\n mailing list.\n\n\nWhat are the Terms and Conditions for PeeringDB membership?\n\n\nPlease see \nhttp://docs.peeringdb.com/gov/#organizational-documents\n for the legal aspects of PeeringDB. An Acceptable Use Policy is under development by the Board. \n\n\nAre there any membership fees required for members?\n\n\nNo, there are no membership fees required. The organization welcomes sponsorships as its method of financial support. Please see \nhttps://www.peeringdb.com/sponsors\n for more information on supporting the PeeringDB.\n\n\nAre there any liabilities imposed on members?\n\n\nNo, there are not.\n\n\nTo register network information in the PeeringDB, is an organization required to join as a member?\n\n\nNo, that isn't necessary.",
