</p>
<blockquote>
"A corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal business entity
may be a Member of the Corporation. Membership is determined by having both an active
PeeringDB.com account and an individual representative or role subscription to the PeeringDB
Governance mailing list: <a href="http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov">
http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov</a>"
</blockquote>

<p>Each Member may submit one ballot. We are employing Single Transferable Vote (STV) as the
voting system. This means that you rank your candidate preferences from most preferred to
least preferred. You do not need to rank all the candidates. A later ballot from a
representative of a Member will replace a previous ballot from the same Member.</p>

<p>
There are 5 seats on the Board of Directors, 3 of which are up for 
election this year. A Director term is 2 years.
</p>

<p>The following schedule applies to Board elections:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Through April 14th 23:59:59 UTC 2025: Candidates may submit their candidacy and a maximum
300 word statement, as determined by the POSIX "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -w" command, or revisions
to their statement, to secretary@peeringdb.com.</p>

<p>April 15th 2025: A voter registration form will be sent to the PeeringDB Governance mailing
list (pdb-gov@lists.peeringdb.com).
</p>

<p>April 15th through 29th 23:59 UTC 2025: Voting. (Registrations received after April 28th
UTC are not guaranteed to be processed in time for the April 29th 23:59 UTC voting deadline.)</p>

<p>
Hi there!
</p>
<p>
I’m Luca Marini, and I’m excited about the possibility of joining the amazing PeeringDB team. I am interested in contributing to the growth of the organization and exploring new
ways for its involvement in carriers’ networks.
</p>
<p>
I am confident that PeeringDB can provide them with more complementary information and continue the invaluable work that our current and former colleagues at PeeringDB have
undertaken to maintain the platform’s stability and independence. Furthermore, I believe that PeeringDB has all the potential to expand in areas where its capabilities have not
yet been fully realised.
</p>
<p>
My main focus would be on ensuring that the platform remains stable, both technically and economically, while making sure that all networks are part of it.
</p>
<p>
Your vote counts, so I hope you’ll consider my candidacy!
</p>

<p>
I own AIRBEAM, an Italian ISP (AS50877—<a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/net/12537">https://www.peeringdb.com/net/12537</a>), which I founded in 2010. I am also a board member of <a href="http://www.aiip.it/">AIIP (www.aiip.it)</a>, the Italian Association of Internet Providers.
</p>
<p>
I serve on the PeeringDB board, am a member of the Outreach Committee, and am running for a second term on the board. Over the past two years, I have actively promoted PeeringDB across various European Network Operator Groups (NOGs) by giving presentations in Italy (ITNOG, MIX-IT), Greece (GRNOG-WispForum.GR), Serbia (RSNOG), France (FRNOG), Finland (NOF.FI), Romania (RONOG), and Sweden (NETNOD Tech Meeting), as well as at RIPE's SEE meetings in Greece and Bulgaria.
</p>
<p>
PeeringDB is essential for networks and facilities, both technically and commercially. Statistics indicate our outreach efforts are effective, as more records are registered in PeeringDB's database. However, there are still operators who are unaware of or do not utilize it.
</p>
<p>
I am committed to continuing this effort in the coming years, working for the community's benefit and exploring new areas where PeeringDB does not have widespread recognition. In May, I will hold a workshop at the LACNIC peering forum, and I am also looking to expand my efforts into the Asian community.
</p>
<p>
**Note:** I have enabled two-factor authentication (2FA) on my PeeringDB account. Have you done the same?
