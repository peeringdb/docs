</p>
<blockquote>
"A corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal business entity
may be a Member of the Corporation. Membership is determined by having both an active
PeeringDB.com account and an individual representative or role subscription to the PeeringDB
Governance mailing list: <a href="http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov">
http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov</a>"
</blockquote>

<p>Each Member may submit one ballot. We are employing Single Transferable Vote (STV) as the
voting system. This means that you rank your candidate preferences from most preferred to
least preferred. You do not need to rank all the candidates. A later ballot from a
representative of a Member will replace a previous ballot from the same Member.</p>

<p>
There are 5 seats on the Board of Directors, 3 of which are up for 
election this year. A Director term is 2 years.
</p>

<p>The following schedule applies to Board elections:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Through April 14th 23:59:59 UTC 2025: Candidates may submit their candidacy and a maximum
300 word statement, as determined by the POSIX "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -w" command, or revisions
to their statement, to secretary@peeringdb.com.</p>

<p>April 15th 2025: A voter registration form will be sent to the PeeringDB Governance mailing
list (pdb-gov@lists.peeringdb.com).
</p>

<p>April 15th through 29th 23:59 UTC 2025: Voting. (Registrations received after April 28th
UTC are not guaranteed to be processed in time for the April 29th 23:59 UTC voting deadline.)</p>

<p>
Hi there!
</p>
<p>
I’m Luca Marini, and I’m excited about the possibility of joining the amazing PeeringDB team. I am interested in contributing to the growth of the organization and exploring new
ways for its involvement in carriers’ networks.
</p>
<p>
I am confident that PeeringDB can provide them with more complementary information and continue the invaluable work that our current and former colleagues at PeeringDB have
undertaken to maintain the platform’s stability and independence. Furthermore, I believe that PeeringDB has all the potential to expand in areas where its capabilities have not
yet been fully realised.
</p>
<p>
My main focus would be on ensuring that the platform remains stable, both technically and economically, while making sure that all networks are part of it.
</p>
<p>
Your vote counts, so I hope you’ll consider my candidacy!
</p>
