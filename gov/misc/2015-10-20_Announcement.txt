Subject: PeeringDB survey results and Board election plan

Results of the survey which ended August 15th, along with anonymous
comments are up at:

  https://www.caputo.com/pdb/20150800_PDB_Survey_results.pdf

91 responses, of which 89 voted for the main question:

 PeeringDB functions should be performed by:

 - 35 votes, 39.33%: "An independent 501(C)(6) (Not for profit) PeeringDB,
      with it's own elected board and members"

 - 14 votes, 15.73%: "The existing global standards body OpenIX 501(C)(6)
      (Not for profit)"

 - 10 votes, 11.24%: "The existing regional organization NANOG 501(C)(3)
      (Not for profit)"

 - 30 votes, 33.71%: "I don't care just as long as PeeringDB keeps
      working"

That looks like a clear vote for independence, given that the number for
independence is 45% more than the combined votes for OpenIX and NANOG.

Based on this, we are going to continue working toward becoming an 
independent non-profit corporation. In the interest of broad support, 
this is going to be done with transparency and inclusion using the pdb-gov 
mailing list. The plan:

 - If you want to participate in the process, please subscribe to the 
   pdb-gov "governance" mailing list with your PeeringDB account email.  

     http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov

 - Further emails will be sent to pdb-gov mailing list and posted to 
   http://gov.peeringdb.com/ as appropriate.

 - pdb-gov is where the draft organizational documents will be discussed
   and refined.  These draft documents are up at:

     https://www.caputo.com/pdb/

 - There will be elections for the initial Board of Directors. Candidacies 
   along with max 300 word statements should be submitted to 
   secretary@peeringdb.com prior to November 15th. Anyone can run for 
   election to the initial Board.

 - The interim Secretary (tentatively Chris Caputo) will send out ballots 
   to pdb-gov on November 15th, with voting to happen through November 
   30th.  The org docs currently proscribe one ballot per member 
   organization.  The interim Secretary will break ties through public 
   random means.  The Secretary will not be eligible for election to the 
   initial Board.

 - The initial Board will decide on officers, per the tentative Bylaws.
   The draft documents will then be signed and filed.
