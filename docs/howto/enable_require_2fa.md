# HOWTO: Turn on 2FA and Require Users to Enable It

## What is 2FA?
2FA is two-factor authentication. Enabling 2FA for PeeringDB means you must both have an account password and another factor.

We support both [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) and [U2F tokens](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/) as additional factors. There are many popular software and hardware devices supporting these standards.
 
## How do users enable 2FA
Click on your account name. Then click on the green "Manage Two-Factor Authentication" box and follow the instructions.
