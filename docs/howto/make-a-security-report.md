# HOWTO: Report a Security Issue to PeeringDB

PeeringDB works hard to keep its systems and data as secure as possible. If you are a security researcher and have discovered a security vulnerability in one of our services, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. 

Our responsible disclosure policy is not an invitation to actively hack and potentially disrupt our system and services. We reserve the right to sue researchers for penetrating or attempting to penetrate our systems.

## PeeringDB does not permit the following types of security research
While we encourage you to discover and report to us any vulnerabilities you find in a responsible manner, the following conduct is prohibited:

* Performing actions that may negatively affect PeeringDB or its users (e.g. any form of Denial of Service attacks)
