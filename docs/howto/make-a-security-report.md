# HOWTO: Report a Security Issue to PeeringDB

PeeringDB works hard to keep its systems and data as secure as possible. If you are a security researcher and have discovered a security vulnerability in one of our services, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. 

Our responsible disclosure policy is not an invitation to actively hack and potentially disrupt our system and services. We reserve the right to sue researchers for penetrating or attempting to penetrate our systems.

## PeeringDB does not permit the following types of security research
While we encourage you to discover and report to us any vulnerabilities you find in a responsible manner, the following conduct is prohibited:

* Performing actions that may negatively affect PeeringDB or its users (e.g. any form of Denial of Service attacks)
* Accessing, or attempting to access, data or information that does not belong to you
* Destroying or corrupting, or attempting to destroy or corrupt, data or information that does not belong to you
* Conducting any kind of physical or electronic attack on PeeringDB personnel, property or data centers
* Using social engineering to target any PeeringDB team member
* Violating any laws or breaching any agreements to discover vulnerabilities

## Scope of the network

The following is in scope:

* The [www.peeringdb.com](https://www.peeringdb.com) website and any of its sub-domains, services, APIs and infrastructure.
* Any (internet-facing) infrastructure owned and operated by PeeringDB.

## Exclusions

The following list of issues have already been reported to our Security team, reviewed, and deemed out of scope for the purposes of this program. Please do not report any of the following classes of issues. Unless there are exceptional circumstances or novel attacks, these issues will be rejected:

* The presence of public services such as robots.txt or FTP.
* The availability of DNS zone transfers.
* Reports of old software versions without a working Proof of Concept of an exploit.
