# PeeringDB 2021 User Survey
PeeringDB wants input from network operators, exchange operators, facility providers, content distributors and anyone who uses our interconnection database. We are running an anonymous satisfaction survey until 23:59 UTC on Friday, 8 October 2021 and would like your feedback to help us make PeeringDB more useful to everyone involved in connecting networks.

We had over 200 responses to last year’s survey and those responses helped guide our product development. We’ve made significant improvements to search based on user input, introduced a [HOWTO documentation series](https://docs.peeringdb.com/howtos/), and are developing a documentation architecture directly as a result of your input. We’d like more input, in 2021, so we can keep up with the industry’s evolving needs.

Steve McManus, PeeringDB Product Committee Chair, says: "*User comments in the 2020 survey helped us focus development where it was most needed. It directly influenced our roadmap and highlighted the need for specific expertise in documentation and user experience design to solve users’ most pressing needs. Thanks to everyone who gives a few moments of their time to help us make PeeringDB a better service!*”

In addition to the questions we asked last year, we have three extra questions about documentation priorities, notifications, and user experience on mobile devices. We are particularly keen to improve our understanding of people’s needs for the website as this was the area with the most divided responses last year.

The survey is available in the six UN languages and Portuguese. We’re happy with people providing free text comments in whichever language they are happiest expressing themselves.

We’ll share the results and the new product roadmap early in 2022.

PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions.
