# PeeringDB Whois Service to Close
We will close down the whois.peeringdb.com service at the end of January 2024.

The PeeringDB whois service is a relic of PeeringDB v1, where there was no API to query the database. PeeringDB v2 can be queried and updated through [our API](https://docs.peeringdb.com/api_specs/) as well as the web. The whois service is just another way to get data from our API that is less supported and infrequently used.

Keeping the service incurs a maintenance cost. We believe that closing the service is the best use of PeeringDB resources.

User comments are welcome on the [user-discuss list](https://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/user-discuss), or direct to the [Product Committee](mailto:productcom@lists.peeringdb.com).

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our low traffic [mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues). If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at [support@peeringdb.com](mailto:support@peeringdb.com).
