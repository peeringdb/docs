# PeeringDB Whois Service to Close

We will close down the `whois.peeringdb.com` service at the end of January 2024.

The PeeringDB whois service is a relic of PeeringDB v1, where there was no API to query the database. PeeringDB v2 can be queried and updated through [our API](/api_specs/) as well as the web. The whois service is just another way to get data from our API that is less supported and infrequently used.

Keeping the service incurs a maintenance cost. We believe that closing the service is the best use of PeeringDB resources.

User comments are welcome on the [user-discuss list](https://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/user-discuss), or direct to the [Product Committee](mailto:productcom@lists.peeringdb.com).

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our low traffic [mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues). If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at [support@peeringdb.com](mailto:support@peeringdb.com).

PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions.
