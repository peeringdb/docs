# Actively Learning and Testing with Our Tutorial Server

You can test how you use PeeringDB with our tutorial server. It’s there to let you check that the configuration you think is right is, in fact, right before you put it into production.

It’s like a lab environment because nothing you do on [tutorial.peeringdb.com](http://tutorial.peeringdb.com) will affect other networks in production. In fact, the tutorial server doesn’t limit you to using unique resources. This means you can “register” a private ASN and use private IP addresses for a peering LAN. There are 94 million private AS Numbers and more than a /8 of private IPv4 and IPv6 space, so plenty to go around.

Another benefit of testing on our tutorial server is that you can create new resources, like accounts, networks, or facilities, instantly. That means you can schedule your testing at your convenience. You don’t need to wait for the Admin Committee to approve anything.

Create an account, log in, add the resources you want to test, and go. 

If you experience any problem with the tutorial server, please let us know at [support@peeringdb.com](mailto:support@peeringdb.com). 

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our low traffic [mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues).

PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions.
