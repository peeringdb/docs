# We're updating our web UI

PeeringDB users [have told us](https://docs.peeringdb.com/blog/peeringdb_2023_roadmap/) that they both love the simplicity of our web UI but want it improved. We have started on a project to update it.

We must update it to fully integrate the new carrier and campus objects. Carrier objects describe providers of high capacity L1 and L2 links into facilities. A campus is a group of interconnected facilities under common ownership.

Our priorities are:

* Improve tabular data available for Campus and Carrier pages 
* Mobile UI optimization
* Personalization features for logged in users
* Visualization of metro areas in a dynamic map
* Wizard framework for supporting creation and editing of objects
* Lazy loading of object data

We'll start with ways to make it easier for users to get the data they want and need. Then we'll look at making it easier for users to update their own data in PeeringDB.

We'll share some of the design options to check they meet usersâ€™ needs. Watch out for future announcements, so you can give us feedback.

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our [low traffic mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly [on GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues). If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at [support@peeringdb.com](mailto:support@peeringdb.com).
