# Alphabetical Search Results

PeeringDB users have told us that data quality and search are what they value most. We have made changes to improve the search experience:

- You can search a radius from any address in [Advanced Search](https://www.peeringdb.com/advanced_search).
- You can filter searches using the criteria important to you.
- You can test our new, faster, [v2 Search](https://www.peeringdb.com/search/v2?q=).

We have just improved v2 search to give back results in alphabetical order. It's a small change but has a big impact.

If there's an exact match for a search term, it will be shown at the very top of the results. Partial matches are shown in alphabetical order.

Try it out! And try out other searches using [v2 Search](https://docs.peeringdb.com/blog/search_gets_better/) and then let us know what you think. We need your feedback to improve search.

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our [low traffic mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly [on GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues). If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at [support@peeringdb.com](mailto:support@peeringdb.com).
