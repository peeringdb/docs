# More ASN Comparisons

We have improved the [ASN Comparison](https://www.peeringdb.com/advanced_search#asn_connectivity) feature. 

![Now with country, filters, and exchanges](images/improved_asn_comparison.png)

You can now compare networks at IXPs as well as in Facilities. We also:

 - Show you country names
 - Let you sort columns
 - Let you dynamically filter the table

And as always, you can export the data.

We added this feature based on a user request. And we’ve improved it based on user feedback.

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our [low traffic mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an issue directly [on GitHub](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb). If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at [support@peeringdb.com](mailto:support@peeringdb.com).

PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions.
