PeeringDB has proven to be a fantastic piece of software and, over the years, has become the de facto source of information for network interconnections. It has grown to be much more than just a database. The present and past teams have done a tremendous job of driving PeeringDB in the right direction. But there is always scope for improvement and innovative ideas to enhance the usability of any product further. And a fresh approach with the right mindset can do wonders. This is what I envision to bring to the table.
</p>
<p>
With my ~20 years of experience in the Internet industry, building a national ISP, engagement with various community efforts and by building and launching a few community software projects over the past decade -- I have learnt quite a few things. I believe, my perspective and guidance can help make PeeringDB a little more useful for all of the stakeholders of the Internet ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
A few studies have concluded that diversity promotes productivity and creativity. 
</p>
<p>
Building a neutral platform for the global village mandates representation from each part of the community. South Asia, where I come from, despite having ~7500 ASNs in the region – has no representation in the PeeringDB board.  For context there are ~27000 total ASNs in PeeringDB.
</p>
<p>
I believe I have given you enough reasons to believe why I might be the ideal candidate.
</p>
<p>
You have got the right to vote, go ahead and use it. :)

I’ve been involved with PeeringDB since its inception. I helped to drive the creation of the not-for-profit organization that exists today. I’ve always been active within the PeeringDB community. I spent time volunteering on what is now the admin committee. I believe that the organization is amazing and the work that has been done so far has been fantastic.
</p>
<p>
I’d like to continue my work on the board, continue to ensure neutrality, and to enable frictionless contributions to PeeringDB.
</p>
<p>
My goals:
</p>
<p>
1) Continue to maintain neutrality as an organization
</p>
<p>
2) Enable contributions to be made to the database with reduced friction
</p>
<p>
3) Driving open-source contributions to PeeringDB
</p>
<p>
4) Improve CLI and API usability of the system
</p>
<p>
5) Enabling a better platform to take in feature requests from the community
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your consideration!

<p>
I'm the owner of a local Italian ISP (Airbeam - AS50877) since 2010 and a board member of <a href="http://www.aiip.it/">AIIP (www.aiip.it)</a>, the Italian Association of Internet Providers.
</p>
<p>
I actively support the ITNOG community development, mainly on the IPv6 topic.
</p>
<p>
In my vision, PeeringDB is a fundamental tool, but there are still operators that don't know/use it.
</p>
<p>
To keep PeeringDB free, a wide audience of operators must keep in mind how important this tool is for the inter-networking business.
