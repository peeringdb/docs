least preferred. You do not need to rank all the candidates. A later ballot from a
representative of a Member will replace a previous ballot from the same Member.</p>

election this year. A Director term is 2 years.

<p>
I’ve been involved with PeeringDB since its inception. I helped to drive the creation of the not-for-profit organization that exists today. I’ve always been active within the PeeringDB community. I spent time volunteering on what is now the admin committee. I believe that the organization is amazing and the work that has been done so far has been fantastic.
</p>
<p>
I’d like to continue my work on the board, continue to ensure neutrality, and to enable frictionless contributions to PeeringDB.
</p>
<p>
My goals:
</p>
<p>
1) Continue to maintain neutrality as an organization
</p>
<p>
2) Enable contributions to be made to the database with reduced friction
</p>
<p>
3) Driving open-source contributions to PeeringDB
</p>
<p>
4) Improve CLI and API usability of the system
</p>
<p>
5) Enabling a better platform to take in feature requests from the community
</p>
<p>
Thanks for your consideration!

<p>
I'm the owner of a local Italian ISP (Airbeam - AS50877) since 2010 and a board member of <a href="http://www.aiip.it/">AIIP (www.aiip.it)</a>, the Italian Association of Internet Providers.
</p>
<p>
I actively support the ITNOG community development, mainly on the IPv6 topic.
</p>
<p>
In my vision, PeeringDB is a fundamental tool, but there are still operators that don't know/use it.
</p>
<p>
To keep PeeringDB free, a wide audience of operators must keep in mind how important this tool is for the inter-networking business.
