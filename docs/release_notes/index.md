# Release Notes and Schedule

The release notes list the GitHub issues and a summary of what has changed in PeeringDB software releases.

Each new release has a one week beta test period on the [beta server](https://beta.peeringdb.com/) before it goes live.  The beta and new releases are announced on the [PeeringDB Announce Mailing List](https://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-announce) and on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PeeringDB), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/peeringdb) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/peeringdb).

## Release schedule

This schedule provides planned dates for PeeringDBâ€™s future releases. We are sharing these dates to help PeeringDB users plan ahead for testing new and improved features in beta. We also want to help volunteer developers know the date on which their code changes are needed for internal testing before beta release.

We provide a rolling schedule. Dates can change, so if you have a question or request please contact us at: [support@peeringdb.com](mailto:support@peeringdb.com).

Our releases are generally deployed at around 04:00 UTC.
