## Quick API start

PeeringDB is available at <https://www.peeringdb.com/> with self-describing API docs at <https://www.peeringdb.com/apidocs/>.  More thorough docs are at [API Specs](api_specs.md), but in a nutshell, just prepend the URL with `api/` to get that object in JSON.

For example:
<https://www.peeringdb.com/net/1>
becomes:
<https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net/1>

List all via API by taking the `id` off:
<https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net>

Local database replication is accomplished with this [command line tool](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb-py), please see the [documentation](http://peeringdb.github.io/peeringdb-py/cli/#sync) for more information.
