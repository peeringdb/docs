PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions. The database is a non-profit, community-driven initiative run and promoted by volunteers. It is a public tool for the growth and good of the Internet. Join the community and support the continued development of the Internet. How do I get started? See our Quick Start guide: http://docs.peeringdb.com/#quick-start Affiliation requests Q: How does affiliation to an organization work? A: After you have registered, go to your profile . If your organization owns a network (also called AS or ASN), type in the AS number into the field ASN . Then click on the button Affiliate . If your ASN already is in PeeringDB and your org record does not yet have an admin account this request will be sent to PeeringDB Support If your organisation already has one or more admins your request is forwarded to them. They will have to approve / deny your request If your ASN is not in PeeringDB this procedure will first try to retrieve information about this ASN via RDAP to prepopulate the net record and the org record in case it also does not exist. We also use information from this query to auto approve your request if the email address in the RDAP record matches your email address. If this fails your request will be sent to PeeringDB Support You may also use the field organisation to request affiliation to an existing or new organisation. Start typing the name of your company and select from the popup or create a new organisation. Your request is sent to your admins if there is one or to PeeringDB Support otherwise In any case you should get an answer either from your admin or PeeringDB Support . If you don't get an answer within two working days, please mail PeeringDB Support providing necessary information (ASN, Organization). Technical How do I query by ASN? You may type in the ASN in the search box, or for web: http://as42.peeringdb.com https://www.peeringdb.com/net?asn=42 For API: https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net?asn=42 Using /asn used to work, what happened? Please see http://lists.peeringdb.com/pipermail/pdb-announce/2016-March/000036.html for details. How do the new permissions work? Now there is an org entity which owns the records. A record can be a facility, an exchange point, or a network. Users are added to the org entity and can then be given access to any facility, any network, any exchange point, or anything the org itself owns. Authenticating via embedded user/pass in the URL Support for this depends on the client and some browsers have stopped supporting embedded authentication in the URL So for example https:// username : password @peeringdb.com/api/net/1 may work or it may not depending on the browser you are using. Why are dates represented as strings in the API? Date strings are ISO 8601 to keep a standard format. Comparison operations such as __gt , __lt , etc all still work as expected. For fetching records against updated timestamp, you may also use ?since= seconds since epoch How do I sync the whole database to my local machine? You may make a full local copy with https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb-py , see docs at http://peeringdb.github.io/peeringdb-py/cli/ The initial run will perform a full sync, while subsequent runs will incrementally update changed records. Alternatively peeringdb-simplesync can be used to maintain a mirror in PostgreSQL. When syncing to MySQL I get 'Illegal mix of collations' Such as: django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1267, \"Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8_general_ci,COERCIBLE) for operation '='\") We will fix that when time allows, for the time being, just run: alter database peeringdb default character set utf8 default collate utf8_unicode_ci; What does the Never via route servers flag mean and how does it work? With release 2.18.0 a new feature Never via route servers (API field info_never_via_route_servers ) has been introduced. There is a tick box in section \"Protocols Supported\" to set it. If set it is a hint for an IXP to use that information to block any BGP updates where the AS_PATH matches the regular expression ASN . Please make sure that the IXPs you are connected to are supporting this feature. I.e. they have to check PeeringDB regularly, evaluate this field and honour the setting. Governance and membership How does one become a PeeringDB member? Your organization does not need to be a Member to have an active account at PeeringDB.com, but Membership is available to those that do. Per the Bylaws, Membership is determined by having an active PeeringDB.com account, and a subscription to the pdb-gov mailing list. What are the Terms and Conditions for PeeringDB membership? Please see http://docs.peeringdb.com/gov/#organizational-documents for the legal aspects of PeeringDB. The Acceptable Use Policy is at https://www.peeringdb.com/aup . Are there any membership fees required for members? No, there are no membership fees required. The organization welcomes sponsorships as its method of financial support. Please see https://www.peeringdb.com/sponsors for more information on supporting the PeeringDB. Are there any liabilities imposed on members? No, there are not. To register network information in the PeeringDB, is an organization required to join as a member? No, that isn't necessary.","title":"FAQs"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"faq/#what-is-peeringdb","text":"PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data.

A: After you have registered, go to your profile . If your organization owns a network (also called AS or ASN), type in the AS number into the field ASN . Then click on the button Affiliate . If your ASN already is in PeeringDB and your org record does not yet have an admin account this request will be sent to PeeringDB Support If your organisation already has one or more admins your request is forwarded to them. They will have to approve / deny your request If your ASN is not in PeeringDB this procedure will first try to retrieve information about this ASN via RDAP to prepopulate the net record and the org record in case it also does not exist. We also use information from this query to auto approve your request if the email address in the RDAP record matches your email address. If this fails your request will be sent to PeeringDB Support You may also use the field organisation to request affiliation to an existing or new organisation. Start typing the name of your company and select from the popup or create a new organisation. Your request is sent to your admins if there is one or to PeeringDB Support otherwise In any case you should get an answer either from your admin or PeeringDB Support .

General remarks The Importer abides by the recommendations of the Data Ownership Task Force and its resulting Policy Document . Most significantly, this means that unless the tick box Allow IXP Update is enabled by a network, published data will not automatically become unpublished nor will unpublished data automatically become published. For Networks There is a tick box Allow IXP Update which governs the behavior of the Importer. By default this is set to disabled. If Allow IXP Update is enabled, a network entry at an IX may automatically be created, changed, or removed. The network's IX entry is completely governed by the settings in the IX-F JSON data provided by the IX. If Allow IXP Update is disabled, differences in data provided by the IX and the network will result in the following: An email to the network with details about the differences. An email to the IX with details about the differences. Admins for the network will see hints for their network within the PeeringDB web interface. These hints may be accepted or dismissed. The network and the IX are encouraged to reach out to each other to resolve any differences. IXP Update Tools: The Preview button shows the changes that will be performed or suggested during the next IX-F import, depending on the Allow IXP Update setting. The Postmortem button shows a log of recent changes performed as a result of IX-F imports. For IXPs To enable IX-F JSON import: Make sure that your JSON file is valid . Provide a URL to your IX-F JSON data. To do so, click Edit on your IX web page and set the IX-F Member Export URL to the URL and set Enable IX-F Import to enabled. You may also set the visibility of your IX-F JSON URL. Daily at 0000 UTC, the IX-F JSON data will be retrieved and processed by the Importer. The steps above for networks will then be followed. If the IX-F JSON state field is present, settings of active , connected , or operational may be used to indicate a network is operational, while a setting of inactive will be interpreted as the network not being operational. This may be used to denote a network in the process of connecting but not yet active, or a network on hiatus. IX-F Import Preview: The Preview button shows the changes that will be performed or suggested, depending on participant Allow IXP Update settings. A JSON form of this preview is available at: https://www.peeringdb.com/import/ixlan/###/ixf/preview (replace ### with the ID that appears in the URL after /ix/ when viewing your IX page) Note : The Importer expects that you also provide IP addresses.

This update looks at improvements we have made to keep data quality high by improving automation, giving users better tools, and making it easier to find and export data in PeeringDB. How to sum up what PeeringDB delivered for its users in 2022? Let's start with some numbers that help describe the scale of the work we\u2019ve done. This year, we put out 10 major releases resolving over 100 issues. These included: Search and export improvements Continued improvements to support for IX-F Member Export Better tools to support organizational admins 10 more HOWTO documents We got contributions from a number of community members, including engineers at Amazon and Google. Search We normalised the names of states and provinces to improve search results. This builds on the improvements to advanced search deployed in 2021, which allow users to drill down to get very specific information and export in structured formats. Managing your organization We improved the way organizational admins can manage their users. Features include the ability to require affiliated users to enable Multi Factor Authentication using authenticator apps or a hardware token, or use a particular email domain. Automation We implemented a process to ensure that old networks are removed from PeeringDB when the RIRs or NIRs deregister their AS Numbers. In combination with regular improvements to our support for the IX-F Member Export Schema, we are ensuring that PeeringDB\u2019s data remains fresh. Operations We built on last year\u2019s improvements to API Key support. We introduced query throttling with authenticated users getting more queries. We also worked with developers of third-party tools that query PeeringDB so that they make efficient queries. We want users to have the best experience they can. So we teamed up with members of the community at the NANOG 86 Hackathon to install our local cache, peeringdb-py , on a wide range of systems. Having tested that we have documented the installation process to make it easier for users to sync PeeringDB to their own infrastructure. Documentation Last year we introduced our HOWTO series . This year we expanded it and have had to organise it into five sections. We probably have an explanation of how to do what you want. If there\u2019s something missing, then please let us know. User support Sometimes users need support. We\u2019ve improved lots of support tools, so we can help users more quickly and effectively. On average, tickets are resolved in under eight hours, with automation managing 40% of this workload. What\u2019s Coming Next? Two major improvements scheduled for early 2023 include further improvements to search, and translation for anonymous web users. We\u2019ll publish a more detailed product roadmap towards the end of January. The improvements we make are only as good as the requests we get from you. We want to make sure that we understand what you need and why. If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our low traffic mailing lists or create an issue directly on GitHub .

Adding support for API Keys in this week\u2019s beta release does this. API Keys will help organizations improve the security of the data they publish while linking the tools to the org itself and not its people. API Keys allow organizations to have authenticated access directly associated with the org itself and not with individual users. Organizations will now have better control of their data and won\u2019t need to tie automation to their users\u2019 credentials, which will improve robust continuity of operations should individuals leave the organization. Organizations previously faced a problem that if a user left, and their PeeringDB account was closed, any update processes that used the user\u2019s account would end. Organizations can now tie automated processes to role accounts, ensuring continuity of operations even when people change. And if you automate searches to find new peers, your scripts can now be updated to collect contact information as well as other details. As more organizations use API Keys to automate more of their interactions with PeeringDB, we will get a better idea of who is using the API and who is not. This will allow us to engage with them so we can understand what they value. Of course, this does not mean that we\u2019ll be abandoning users who want to focus on using the web interface. Aris Lambrianidis, a senior security engineer with White Case LLP, says: \u201c The ability to leverage API keys means that programmatic workflows can work reliably using an authentication and authorization model independently of any credentials assigned to humans.

That was the question we asked two focus groups on 29 June 2021. Initial discussion Our Product Committee and others have been discussing this issue for about six months now. The one thing we could agree on was that we needed to reach out to more of the people involved in buying and delivering these interconnection services to help make a decision. Focus groups To do that we held two focus groups on 29 June 2021. One was scheduled at a time that is good for people in APAC and the west coast of the Americas. The other was scheduled at a time that was good for people in EMEA and the east coast of the Americas. The discussion included 12 people with significant industry experience in running carriers, exchanges, facilities, and networks. To build a trusted environment we applied the Chatham House Rule, so this blog post describes what was discussed but does not quote anyone or attribute views to any participants. The focus groups began with a description of the problem and then looked at a simple approach to address it: an object to describe the carrier and associated objects listing the facilities and IXs where they have a presence. The focus groups then discussed several questions: Is there an unmet need? Should PeeringDB be the organization to address it? What do you feel about the proposed approach? Should the proposed approach be adapted in some way? Why? There was a strong sense across both sessions that it can be a challenge to find out about connectivity options between locations. While putting information about those options in PeeringDB would not eliminate the need for buyers to perform their own due diligence checks, it would simplify the process of finding out who to contact and what they might be able to offer. There was support for putting this information in PeeringDB because keeping related information in a single database makes things easier for users. Participants favored starting off with a less complex object and adding detail in future iterations. Including information about whether links between locations were L1, L2, or L3, and owned or leased seemed to be the agreed minimum set of information. That said, there were concerns that keeping this information accurate could be a challenge for multiple reasons, including inaccurate internal asset databases and a desire from marketing people to overclaim. Any implementation would need to be well supported by extensions to the API. Despite making it easy for people to rapidly deploy information about new and improved deployments to PeeringDB through the API there was support ensuring that a new object can be created and configured through the web interface. Next steps When the Product Committee has evaluated the feedback we got from these two focus groups it will make a decision on the principle of creating this new object.

Our web and API services impose query limits. Network latency is sometimes a factor when querying from far away. That's why we have peeringdb-py . This is a cache you can run in your own network or even on a laptop. You synchronize the whole database to a machine you run. Once you've done that you are only limited by your own infrastructure. Re-synchronizing peeringdb-py is efficient - it only syncs changes since the last sync - and is unlikely to trigger any query limits if updated once per hour or less frequently as needed. Are there reasons you should run a local cache other than query limits and latency? Yes. If you populate internal databases or generate configurations with PeeringDB then a local cache adds reliability. You'll have local access instead of having to rely on intermediate networks. Of course, peeringdb-py isn't the only choice. Some organizations have developed their own local caches. If you want a local cache you are welcome to use the peeringdb-py codebase as a reference. And if all you need is to have PeeringDB in a local database, it can be really simple . If your organization is a heavy PeeringDB user then work out the right caching approach for you.

While that\u2019s a success it comes with a responsibility to enhance transparency over what is required when registering a network, IXP, or facility in the database. We have just published a set of guidelines that document the criteria our automation uses, or will use when new software is developed. Where we cannot automate, volunteers on our Admin Committee evaluate requests. There are clear criteria for the automatic, or semi-automatic, approval of each type of object. These are illustrated with flowcharts that show the possible paths through the process. What Are They? Networks must have a unique and properly registered ASN. IXP LANs must use unique and properly registered address space. There are some automatic prefix limits but these can be manually overridden when needed. Facilities can automatically be added by organizations that already have a facility, be validated by a web page offering interconnection services there, or be attested to by users that confirm the facility exists. There is also a process to remove empty facilities without registered networks or IXPs present in them. Feedback Loop We know that these guidelines will need to be improved and updated as we learn, so we have built in an \u201cexception\u201d process to help with that.

Today, we are sharing what you told us through the survey and how we\u2019ll be improving PeeringDB and your experience of it in 2022. Highlights We had almost 250 responses to the survey, a 25% increase on last year. As with last year, respondents identified themselves as connected with organizations operating on every continent and in every part of our industry. Overall satisfaction remains unchanged from last year. We asked a few new questions in 2021 and learned: Almost 70% of respondents use PeeringDB every day or every week. Most of the rest use it every month. Under half of respondents use PeeringDB on a mobile device. About 70% of respondents want a way to be notified about changes that are relevant to them. From the questions that were repeated from 2021 we learned that Network Configuration Data and Search and Discovery capabilities remained the most important to our users. The User Experience and Web Interface remained the service categories with the lowest satisfaction, although 85% of respondents were still somewhat or very satisfied. The other lower performing area was Documentation Quality, which is an area that we started to address later in 2021 and some respondents won't have known about. Work on improving our documentation will continue in 2022. We hope that these improvements drive satisfaction in 2022. Roadmap We have used your feedback, in combination with a focus group consultation , to guide our product roadmap for 2022. The three key focus areas will be: Introduce a new \u201cCarrier\u201d object This object will describe providers of high capacity links between interconnection facilities. It was named \u201cCarrier\u201d during the discussion but that is a placeholder that could be changed if it is considered confusing or inappropriate. We are developing a design which will be circulated with the focus group before developing this new feature. As a new object, we\u2019ll make sure that it is well documented so users can get the most value from it. Improving the web site\u2019s responsiveness We recognize that the overall visual design needs some improvement. But perhaps more importantly we need to improve page load times. We plan to bring PeeringDB nearer to its users by completing deployment to a CDN. We have already tested this by deploying beta.peeringdb.com there and we will be moving www.peeringdb.com to it in 2022. We will also introduce modular page rendering, so each element loads via a separate connection, speeding the overall experience. We will use the CDN metrics to learn more about how www.peeringdb.com is used and that will inform improvements to the visual design. Continue improving search 2021 saw significant improvements to advanced search and simple search. We will continue to make improvements to search and help users keep the underlying data more accurate. One example of this is work that\u2019s going on, as I type, at the NANOG 84 Hackathon where volunteer developers are introducing intersection searches . That means you\u2019ll be able to make a single query to find out which IXPs or interconnection facilities have two networks present, such as your own and a desired peer\u2019s. This is an example of how PeeringDB is developed by its users as well as the core team. What else? Data accuracy We know that we need to do work to improve the quality of data in PeeringDB as it plays such an important role in configuration. We last looked at this in 2019\u2019s Data Ownership Task Force , whose report acknowledged the shared responsibility for data describing the interconnected nature of separately managed parts of our Internet. We plan to work with PeeringDB users to renew our work in this area so we can continue to improve the quality of data we publish. We are also setting course towards increased data accuracy by using the RPKI and Resource Signed Checklists (RSC). We want to use RSC validation to cryptographically validate our users\u2019 ability to control specific Internet Number Resources. Call to action We just deployed two user developed features: improvements to simple search and OpenID Connect integration. We are keen to include more user developed code.

We'd like to know how many people use PeeringDB at your organization. We'd also like to know how you use it: web, API, or via a local cache. We will use your answers to focus development work where it is most needed. The survey is available in the six UN languages, Portuguese and Ukrainian. Please provide comments in whatever language you want to express yourself. We\u2019ll share the results and the new product roadmap early in 2023. So CLICK HERE to help guide PeeringDB\u2019s future development. If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our low traffic mailing lists or create an issue directly on GitHub . If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at . PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data.

This blog post describes what we have planned for the start of the year. It also describes how we want to work over the whole year, and how you can help us make good choices. We are starting the year with features that open new paths to us. Your input will help us choose how we move down them. Our roundup of 2022 noted that we have some big things planned for the start of 2023. The two biggest are two new objects. We deployed the first in our January release. The new carrier object is a way for providers of high capacity links to show which interconnection facilities they are in. We\u2019ve deployed the minimal possible structure for this new object. We want users to tell us what additional features they cannot do without. The next big new addition is a campus object. This will be a way for interconnection facilities to show that inter-building cross-connects are available with the same ease as those within a building. This will help buyers understand when they don't need to be in the same building as something they want to connect to. We can expand either or both of these objects. We need your feedback to help us decide what would make them more valuable. Respondents to our annual surveys have consistently told us that Network Configuration Data is what they value most. They are also quite divided about the website design. Some people love its simplicity and others want something more modern. We knew that we didn't have enough information to make good decisions on how to improve things for the people who want change without disappointing those who like it the way it is. We have deployed Google Analytics for beta.peeringdb.com and would like to deploy it to www.peeringdb.com and docs.peeringdb.com . This will give us important information about how people use our site. We\u2019ll use this information to understand the problems people experience and develop ways to solve them. We also have lots of users who rely on our API or a local cache of PeeringDB data. So, we want to make it easier for users to identify the deltas between what they have in PeeringDB and their local configuration management. This is the focus on the projects we're taking to the NANOG 87 Hackathon . We want to work with tool developers and anyone who relies on PeeringDB as a source of network configuration data. Ultimately, we'd like to offer a way for users to automatically identify deltas, the changes that could be made, and ways to make or approve those changes. Across the rest of the year, we'd like to focus on one theme at a time and deliver a set of significant improvements there. Then we can move on to the next relevant theme. So please let us know how we could make PeeringDB more valuable for your organization. As always, you can submit an issue, or comment on existing issues in GitHub . But you can also send us email or chat to us at various community events. PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data.

Simple Search is Smarter Search As reported by NANOG last week, we have deployed code developed by Brad Schwyzer, James Lamanna, and Jeff Kala that significantly improves the accuracy of what we call Simple Search. This is the main search box on the front page or the basic API call. Until this month it provided an enthusiastic number of responses when searching for things like small AS Numbers. While the answers weren\u2019t wrong, our users needed to pay extra attention to find what they needed. Brad, James, and Jeff developed logic to work out what users are likely to be searching for and give them the most relevant results. Simple Search now knows about the difference between an AS Number, an IPv4 address, and an IPv6 address. It will only respond with IP address information if at least two segments of the address are included in the search. They turned this: Into this: We are grateful to them and to NANOG, who hosted the Hackathon where this code was developed. We are keen to participate in more Hackathons in the future. OpenID Connect We also deployed code developed by Carlos Aguado to implement OpenID Connect . This builds on our existing support for OAuth to enable identity federation with managed services. The code Carlos developed means that PeeringDB can be used as an OpenID Authorization Server so that any PeeringDB user can sign in to other websites. Your Code If you are a software developer who needs something from PeeringDB we might be able to deploy code you develop.

The Admin Committee functions as the first point of contact for any inquiries to PeeringDB. The Admin Committee produces definitions for enhancements to the workflow and Admin GUI and works with the Product Committee to plan a coherent roadmap for the PeeringDB software. Out of scope Work covered in the charter of the Operations, Outreach, Product, and further to be established Committees Deliverables Take care of support tickets, the Admin Committee strives to answer tickets within 24 hours Gather input from end-users regarding the improvement of PeeringDB in terms of bugs and product features and channel them towards the Product Committee via GitHub Improve PeeringDB Admin GUI to help expedient resolution of support tickets Collaboration The Admin Committee works with other PeeringDB committees to ensure an equitable division of development resources in recognition of the volunteer efforts that are ensuring the daily operations. Participation The PeeringDB Admin Committee members serve a one-year renewable term. Volunteers can submit their candidacy to the Admin Committee Chair. The Chair and Vice Chair will choose a new Admin Committee member at any time they see the necessity to ensure the continuity of the Admin Committee. There is a trial period of one month. New members are onboarded by a more experienced committee member (WebEx / Google Hangouts / 3 example tickets). After the trial period appointment is confirmed by the Chair and Vice Chair for one year.

Initial document. v2. Added multiple mechanisms to validate IXP and Network. v3. Added mechanism to validate facility. v4. Added draft flowcharts and placed explanatory text in an appendix. Minor readability revisions. Guideline goals This guide does not seek to define what an Internet Exchange, or Network operator, or Facility is. PeeringDB is a registry of information. What people do with the information is up to them. In these guidelines, we attempt to merely document PeeringDB\u2019s approval process. Key goals include: The Admin Committee can use multiple to validate and facilitate the creation of objects. Workflows are shown and always include the option to fall back to an exception process. This process brings more eyes and helps PeeringDB identify areas for improvement. Provide a few tangible examples of how to apply the guidelines. Definitions User - a person submitting a new object to the PeeringDB database RIR - A Regional Internet Registry (AFRINIC, APNIC, ARIN, LACNIC or the RIPE NCC) NIR - A National Internet Registry recognized by one of the RIRs Additional terminology is described in Section 4 of the PeeringDB Data Ownership Policy Document . Approving Network ( net ) objects The key to approving Network objects is to confirm the User has a relationship to the specified Autonomous System Number (ASN) and is authorized to represent that ASN in some form. PeeringDB follows industry best practices and has the following requirements for the Autonomous System numbers, regardless of who the User is: ASNs must be registered through an RIR or NIR The ASN must not already be registered in PeeringDB This means that \u201cPrivate\u201d ASNs, as listed in the IANA Autonomous System (AS) Numbers Registry or \u201cBogon\u201d ASNs, those which have not yet been assigned by an RIR or NIR, cannot be registered in PeeringDB. Flowchart There are various mechanisms to verify the relationship between the User and a given Autonomous System number: The registration details listed in WHOIS match the registration details in the sign-up request (same email domain) The registration details listed in RDAP match the registration details in the sign-up request (same email domain) The user can confirm the relationship to the ASN through a RPKI based challenge/response (work in progress: draft-ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc) The user can confirm the relationship to the ASN by entering a PeeringDB suggested random string in their WHOIS record in a comments/remarks field (not yet implemented, a similar strategy to how Amazon AWS does BYOIP) Exception approval follows the standard process PeeringDB encourages but does not require its users to follow industry best practices. This means we recommend: Making a BGP looking glass publicly available, or A website listing the Network services, and a publicly documented Routing Policy Approving IXP ( ix ) objects The key to approving IXP objects is to confirm the User has a relationship to the specified Peering LAN Prefix, and is authorized to represent this IP block in some form. Flowchart Globally unique IP prefix requirements IP prefix must be registered through an RIR or NIR. The prefix must not overlap with any existing IXP object in PeeringDB IPv4 prefixes must not be longer than a /27 or shorter than /19 IPv6 prefixes must not be shorter than /64 but may be longer i.e. a /120 is allowed but a /63 is not Users can verify their relationship to an IP prefix in several ways: The registration details listed in WHOIS match the registration details in the sign-up request (same email domain). The registration details listed in RDAP match the registration details in the sign-up request (same email domain). The user can confirm the relationship to the IP prefix through a RPKI based challenge/response (work in progress - draft-ietf-sidrops-rpki-rsc). The user can confirm the relationship to the IP prefix by entering a PeeringDB suggested random string in their inetnum record in the authoritative RIR or NIR database in a comments/remarks field (note: IRR route/route6 objects cannot be used for this purpose). RDAP should be used to discover which RIR or NIR is authoritative For Legacy IPv4 space, a PeeringDB suggested random string can be placed in a TXT record for the reverse DNS label representing the first IPv4 address in the prefix. (This is a variant of the Amazon AWS BYOIP process). The assumption is that if someone controls Reverse DNS for a given prefix, they have full control over the prefix. Exception approval follows the standard process PeeringDB encourages but does not require its users to follow industry best practices. This means we recommend: A website detailing the IXP service A public overview of connected members and locations, service level, and terms of membership. Approving Facility ( fac ) objects A \u201cfacility\u201d is a physical location where two or more IP Networks or IXPs interconnect with each other. The key to approving Facility objects is to confirm with multiple existing PeeringDB users that a facility exists. Note: We will need to extend PeeringDB's software to support the workflow described here. Note: The IP addresses used in the attestation process will be logged. Validation mechanisms The owner of the facility is an existing PeeringDB user, and adds the facility to their record themselves. In this approval flow the facility is \u2018claimed\u2019. For this workflow the facility owner should already have one facility previously validated via one of the following mechanisms: The owner of the facility is not a PeeringDB user, but interested parties (who are PeeringDB users) wish the Facility object to be registered. The result is an unclaimed Facility object. The building has a website that has an interconnection or colocation section or One user will suggest the facility (peeringdb.com/suggest/fac), after filling in the details the form will generate a unique URL where the attestations can be collected. The user then distributes the URL (which can only be accessed by logged-in users) to the other interested parties, who can then attest or disprove the facility. When 3 PeeringDB users positively attest the facility exists, the facility is approved. The owner of the facility is a new peeringdb user and does not have any objects associated with their account. There are two mechanisms to claim a Facility object. The building has a website that has an interconnection or colocation section or An attestation process similar to how new facilities are suggested by existing users is followed, where the attempting-to-claim PeeringDB user must collect 3 positive attestations from three existing PeeringDB users. Exception approval follows the standard process Flowchart - Facility Flowchart - Attestation Flagging as \"junk\" PeeringDB users can flag a facility as \u201cjunk\u201d. This puts the Facility object in a review queue. The Admin Committee can resolve in the following ways: The facility owner becomes a PeeringDB user and claims the facility. The 3 people who attested that the facility exists can point at two existing PeeringDB IXP or Network object owners who are willing to attest they are present in the facility. The Admin Committee contacts the IXP or Network object owners and asks them to confirm their presence in the facility. At this point the facility record will list at least two network and/or IXP objects. A facility without networks or IXPs is considered potential \u201cjunk\u201d. Empty facilities will be deleted after 90 days. This happens when neither the owner of the facility, nor any other PeeringDB users were willing to indicate a relationship to the facility. The \u201cjunk\u201d button only appears in the UI for objects which are both unclaimed, and where no networks or IXPs indicate a presence. Checklist to help find entities present at the facility and or understand who the facility owner is Website operated by the facility owner: recommended and SHOULD list colocation or interconnection as a service Government or Industry Association website listing facilities. (Example: CLLI locators in the United States) Website of IXPs or Networks publishing they operate in the building Example facility object approval scenarios Facility approval example 1 Facility located at 100 W Main Street, Nowhere, WV, USA. Facility has four ISPs that interconnect in the basement of the building. Three out of the four ISPs have staff with PeeringDB accounts. Building owner has provided a closet for this to occur. Building has no website, the building owner does not know anything about interconnection, and has no plans to market the building as an interconnection location. Start ISP operator A files a request to suggest a Facility object to be entered into PeeringDB. Validation Process The facility owner is not a PeeringDB user, so the mechanism of the facility owner themselves suggesting the facility cannot be applied. The act of suggesting the facility in the PeeringDB user interface generates a unique URL which ISP Operator A can share with the fellow ISPs. If at least 2 other PeeringDB users attest the facility exists, the Facility object is created and marked as \u201cunclaimed\u201d. Facility approval example 2 A PeeringDB user noticed the Facility object created (as a result of Example 1), and reports it as \u201cjunk\u201d. The object continues to exist, but is added to a review queue for the PeeringDB Admin Committee to help resolve the situation. The Admin Committee\u2019s task is to find positive proof the facility exists and interconnection happens. Validation Process The AC committee first contacts the original PeeringDB users that provided attestations the facility exists. (Note: these PeeringDB users themselves might not be present in the facility). The AC can request the original attesters to provide a list of ISPs or IXPs they think are present in the facility. The AC can then contact the ISPs and/or IXPs who were suggested to have a presence in the facility and ask them to either attest the facility exists, or to add themselves as \u2018present\u2019 in the facility. It is possible these ISPs and/or IXPs are not yet PeeringDB users. If the AC can\u2019t collect the attestations the facility will be deleted in 90 days. Facility approval example 3 A Facility owner is a PeeringDB user and wishes to add its facility to PeeringDB using the \u201cSuggest a Facility\u201d function. The building owner is leasing suites to carriers in the basement of his facility, but primarily focuses on leasing office space. The building has a webpage, but data center/interconnection services are not listed on the webpage. The building owner has provided a list of four carriers who have leased space in the building. Validation Process The building owner can add webpage showing that they provide interconnection services. The attestation process can be used to demonstrate the building is used for interconnection. Facility approval example 4 An existing facility operator with other facilities listed in PeeringDB submits a new facility that does not yet have any customers. Validation Process None - The facility should be immediately added. After the Facility object has been added, networks and IXPs can indicate their presence. Exception process We know that these guidelines will need to be improved and updated as we learn, so we have built in an \u201cexception\u201d process to help with that. Whenever an easy path is not possible, the requester can ask for more review of their registration request. The first step in this process is to get input from all the volunteers on the Admin Committee. If more eyes are needed, the request can be shared with all of PeeringDB\u2019s Stewards, a group made from the committee chairs and board members. Where a formal decision is needed, the board can vote on a request and make a final decision. Flowchart Appendix Why must peering LANs be between /27 and /19 (IPv4) and not shorter than /64 (IPv6)? This limit is intended to reduce the likelihood of a typo that goes undetected and causes operational issues. Where a peering LAN uses a /28 or a /18 (IPv4) the Admin Committee can manually process the prefix after verifying its prefix length is correct. The technical standards do not allow LANs to have prefixes shorter than a /64, so a /63 would be rejected to avoid causing operational issues to operator equipment that is standards compliant.","title":"Admin Committee Guidelines and Criteria for Approving Networks, IXPs, and Facilities"},{"location":"committee/admin/approval-guidelines/#admin-committee-guidelines-and-criteria-for-approving-networks-ixps-and-facilities","text":"","title":"Admin Committee Guidelines and Criteria for Approving Networks, IXPs, and Facilities"},{"location":"committee/admin/approval-guidelines/#authors","text":"Chris Malayter Arnold Nipper Job Snijders","title":"Authors"},{"location":"committee/admin/approval-guidelines/#document-history","text":"v1.

If the Chair or Vice Chair become permanently unavailable, replacement(s) are elected from the remaining committee members, subject to PeeringDB Board approval. Decision making process and workflow Product Committee members are responsible for driving the development of PeeringDB. To do this, GitHub issues are used to track proposed and in progress work. Product Committee members play two roles in driving forward work: 1) As a shepherd - responsible for driving consensus for a given issue 2) As a stakeholder - voting on a consensus that has been reached Each Product Committee member will choose issues to shepherd to a decision. They will indicate responsibility for this task by assigning the issue to themselves and placing it in the Decide queue. To decide whether we act on a given issue that has been reported, a stakeholder group will be formed. This group will consist of Product Committee members, who are responsible for representing the users of PeeringDB. A stakeholder group on a given issue must consist of at least three Product Committee members, including the shepherding member. Any Product Committee member can be a stakeholder in the decision on an issue. They become a stakeholder on a given issue by either commenting on the issue on GitHub or participating in discussion of the issue on the Product Committee Mailing list. It is up to the shepherding member to help reach a unanimous consensus within the stakeholder group on what should be done with the issue - including not acting on it. If and only if there are opposing views on how to proceed, and unanimous consensus cannot be reached by the stakeholder committee members, decisions fall to the entire Product Committee (see below). The final proposal of how to resolve each issue, along with votes from stakeholders must be documented in the GitHub issue to be considered to have reached consensus. Product Committee members must document any offline discussion in the GitHub issue to ensure transparency of the discussion process. Issues in the Decide queue are regularly reviewed by the Product Committee to make sure the most impactful issues are being moved along to resolution. All issues in the Decide queue will be reviewed in the monthly Product Committee call to ensure stakeholders have reached consensus and to give members who have not participated in the issue an opportunity to participate. After an issue with consensus has been reviewed, Product Committee members who disagree with the proposal have five days after the monthly Product Committee call to vote against the proposed solution, otherwise the issue will move to the backlog. For any issues where consensus cannot be reached, an issue may move forward only if a quorum of 50% or more of the Product Committee has no more than 25% of the quorum in opposition to the issue.

In recent years, the vision of PeeringDB has developed to keep up with the speed and diverse manner in which the Internet is growing. The database is no longer just for peering and peering related information. It now includes all types of interconnection data for networks, clouds, services, and enterprise, as well as interconnection facilities that are developing at the edge of the Internet. We believe in, and rely on the community to grow and improve the PeeringDB database. The volunteers who run the database are passionate about security, privacy, integrity, and validation of the data in the database. Even though PeeringDB is a freely available and public tool, users strictly adhere to the acceptable use policy, which prevents the database from being used for commercial purposes and discourages unsolicited communications. This is largely policed by the community and has been very effective since PeeringDB was launched. API What is our API? An Application Programming Interface (API) is a way for computer software to communicate with other computers software. Our API allows PeeringDB users to query and update PeeringDB programmatically. That means they can automate work instead of using the website. What Are API keys? An API key is a secret token for identifying and authenticating a user. That user can be an individual or an organization. That\u2019s why we support both user and organizational API keys. PeeringDB offers API keys for authenticating API requests. There are two main forms of API keys: User-level Organizational-level User-level API keys These API keys are tied to an individual user account and can be created from the user profile page. There are only two permission levels: a normal key will mirror the same permissions of the user, while a readonly key will have read only permissions to all the same namespaces as the user. Organization-level API keys These API keys are created and revoked from the organization admin panel. Each key gets its own custom permissions, which can be modified from the API Key Permissions panel. Each key must have an email attached to it. This is because keys may be allowed to create and modify data in PeeringDB, and we need a contact to reach out to in case of questions. You should use an organization-level API key for automation that should not be tied to individual users. Copy or write down keys immediately The full API key string is only ever exposed to the user or organization at its moment of creation . If this string is lost, then the user or organization should revoke that key and create and permission a new one. Command line example using Python and requests API keys allow developers to interact with their PeeringDB account programmatically, rather than through the website. Here is an example script in Python. It uses the module Requests to GET data about a particular Facility, and then sends a PUT request to modify that data. This example assumes we have an environment variable set with our API key. To do that from the command line, we can run: export API_KEY= [created api key string] Then the Python script would look like the following. First we get the API key from the environment: import os import requests API_KEY = os.environ.get( API_KEY ) We set the url for the Facility we want to interact with. Note the /api in the URL, which signals we are making calls to the REST API. URL = https://www.peeringdb.com/api/fac/1 We set the headers to include our API key as authorization. Printing the headers variable should allow us to see the API key. headers = { Authorization : Api-Key + API_KEY} print(headers) First we make a GET request, to simply get data about example Facility number 1 response = requests.get(URL, headers=headers) data = response.json()[ data ][0] print(data) Printing this data allows us to see what fields we would like to change. Let's say we decide to change the name of this facility. We overwrite the value for key \"name\" data[ name ] = Newly decided name Then we use a PUT request to send that modified data back to PeeringDB. Note that this time, we must provide data to the API, using the keyword argument \"data\" put_response = requests.put(URL, headers=headers, data=data) We can print the status code to see if our request was successful. print(put_response.status_code) This will return a code 200 to signal success. Additionally the content of the request should include data for the now modified Facility print(put_response.json()) Would return a dictionary of the values of the now modified Facility. Command line example using curl API keys provide a cleaner way to authenticate API requests. PeeringDB recommends the command line user creates a API_KEY variable like so export API_KEY= [created api key string] then requests can be made with Curl like in the following examples: GET The following request would return JSON data coresponding to the ChiX Internet Exchange. curl -H Authorization: Api-Key $API_KEY -H Content-Type: application/json -X GET https://www.peeringdb.com/api/ix/239 POST The following request would create a new Network under the organization United IX . curl -H Authorization: Api-Key $API_KEY -H Content-Type: application/json -X POST --data {\\ org_id \\ :\\ 10843\\ , \\ name \\ :\\ Brand New Network\\ , \\ asn \\ :\\ 63311\\ } https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net PUT The following request would update the data about a particular Network, ChIX Route Servers , in particular changing the name to \"Edited Name\". curl -H Authorization: Api-Key $API_KEY -H Content-Type: application/json -X PUT --data {\\ org_id \\ :\\ 10843\\ , \\ name \\ :\\ Edited Name\\ , \\ asn \\ :\\ 33713\\ } https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net/7889 DELETE The following request would delete the ChiX Internet Exchange.

It also explains how organizations can apply policies for their affiliated users. Why authenticate? You don't need to login to make single queries to PeeringDB. But some features do require you to authenticate. Update the database If you want to make updates then you need to authenticate. You can update PeeringDB via the API if you want. So you can either login to the website to make changes, or automate them with tools if you prefer. Access contact data We encourage you to publish contact information for your facility, IXP, or network. You can choose to make contact information public but many organizations limit it to other PeeringDB users. So you\u2019ll need to authenticate if you want access to most contact information. Higher query limits Authenticated users are allowed more frequent API queries. They are also able to repeat an identical API query more frequently without being throttled. Help PeeringDB\u2019s operations team If you authenticate when you send queries, we can contact you if your PeeringDB use starts to cause an unexpected problem. If you don\u2019t authenticate then all we can do is restrict queries from your IP address. Password You can use password authentication. We recommend adding MFA to password authentication. Multi-factor authentication We support two MFA methods. You can either use a time-based one-time password, as defined in RFC 6238 or a FIDO U2F hardware token. You can configure these in your account profile. OAuth Some external services allow or require you to authenticate using your PeeringDB account. One example is networks' peering portals. They might use PeeringDB's OAuth service to ensure they can automate configuration. Automating PeeringDB access API keys We support both user and organizational API keys. You should use organizational API keys when you don't want to tie your application to an individual. We have a detailed guide on how to create, configure, and use API keys. Authentication HTTP header The HTTP authentication header must use the same character set the connection is using. This example shows a request and HTTP response: $ curl -v -sG https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net/416 -H 'Authorization: Api-Key example.valid_apikey' 2 1 | grep \\ \\ HTTP HTTP/2 200 This example shows what happens if the API key is not authorized: $ curl -v -sG https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net/416 -H 'Authorization: Api-Key example.invalid_apikey' 2 1 | grep \\ \\ HTTP HTTP/2 401 Canonical URL The canonical URL for PeeringDB is https://www.peeringdb.com . There is a redirect from https://peeringdb.com but we strongly encourage use of the canonical URL since industry practice in software packages is to drop the authentication header upon redirect, as a safety precaution. Password authentication Using an API key for command line access is simple and more secure.

In recent years, the vision of PeeringDB has developed to keep up with the speed and diverse manner in which the Internet is growing. The database is no longer just for peering and peering related information. It now includes all types of interconnection data for networks, clouds, services, and enterprise, as well as interconnection facilities that are developing at the edge of the Internet. We believe in, and rely on the community to grow and improve the PeeringDB database. The volunteers who run the database are passionate about security, privacy, integrity, and validation of the data in the database. Even though PeeringDB is a freely available and public tool, users strictly adhere to the acceptable use policy, which prevents the database from being used for commercial purposes and discourages unsolicited communications. This is largely policed by the community and has been very effective since PeeringDB was launched. Why? PeeringDB is the interconnection database. Registering information about your carrier in PeeringDB makes it visible to IXPs and network operators who want to use your services to bring in peer or connect to other parts of their own network. Getting started Routine use of PeeringDB can be automated using our API but this document is intended to help new carrier administrators get started. Carriers are set up using the web interface. Once this is done you can use the API to automate things that change regularly. This document focuses on the key steps for establishing your presence in PeeringDB and assumes you are using the web interface, which is available in 14 languages. If you need additional help getting started, please contact us at: support@peeringdb.com . What is a Carrier? The carrier object is used to describe providers offering L1 or L2 services in a facility . It is different from a net because that describes services provided at L3 and is linked to its autonomous system number. Information required You will need to create several database records, known as objects, to establish your presence in PeeringDB. Database objects organize relevant information. Most information is optional but sharing all the relevant information maximizes the benefit you get from listing in PeeringDB. You can create your entry with the minimum required data and add and update the information you share over time. To maximize the value of your entry in PeeringDB you\u2019ll probably want to include more than the minimum required information. Your company name is required. This information is not required but is useful: AKA - If your carrier has an alternative name you can show it here to improve visibility in searches Long name - If your carrier has a long name, you can show it here to improve visibility in searches Notes - this field, which supports Markdown , can be used to describe the characteristics of your carrier that would be most useful to PeeringDB users You can look at the information shared by other PeeringDB users to work out what your organization should be sharing. Database records to create User The org is the parent for the carrier but you will need to start the process by creating a user account. If you use a role account for a PeeringDB user you should update the password when people who had access to the role account leave your organization. If you use a ticketing system, please make sure it does not auto-respond in a way that generates a slew of new tickets. Org The org object is your organization\u2019s core record in PeeringDB. All it needs is an organization name but you can add extra value by including information about where your organization is located. You could specify as little as a country name or as much as a full postal address. Your org object will be assigned a numeric identifier, called its id . This is what will be referenced by any child carrier object. Carrier Once you have created your organization you may add the carrier object. You do this by using the Add Carrier tab in the \u201cManage\u201d menu below your organization. You then click the edit button in the top right of the carrier screen and indicate which facilities your carrier has a presence in. The manager of the facility needs to approve the association.

Django manages interaction with the database. We publish all our code on GitHub. We have documented how to set up our development environment. What to develop PeeringDB users can request features and report bugs by creating issues on GitHub . Review open issues to either find a project you\u2019d like to work on, or to see if there\u2019s an existing issue for the feature you want. If you want to develop a feature that has not been discussed on GitHub, you should either create an issue or contact us to discuss what you need. You can send a message to productcom@lists.peeringdb.com or contact any of the members of the Product Committee . If you want to develop code for an issue that has achieved consensus on GitHub, we suggest starting with issues labeled as \"Good first issue\". These are simple issues that will help you get a feel for PeeringDB. Style Before you start developing code look at how similar functions have been implemented. Use the same design as existing functions and develop unit tests for your code. We aim for 80% unit test coverage. You also need to run black on your code before submitting a pull request. We use black to ensure that all of our code has the same formatting. Reusing designs, developing unit tests, and using consistent formatting makes it easier for us to maintain the code over time. We keep the feature parity between the web interface and the API. A feature added to one needs to be added to the other. The implementation details documented in issues should be detailed enough to use as documentation for the web interface. Documentation is also needed for the API. The minimum we need for API documentation is an example of how to format the request and a pointer to the document section to update. Pull requests It's good to let us know which issues you are working on when you start work. It's also helpful if you include the issues being fixed in your pull request. Please include \"Fixes #issue\" for each issue addressed in your pull request. We can then close those issues when we deploy your code. What happens next? When you submit your pull request we will run continuous integration tests on the code. We'll also review it ourselves.

To maximize the value of your entry in PeeringDB you\u2019ll probably want to include more than the minimum required information. This information is required: Company Name Full street address This information is not required but is useful: AKA - If your facility has an alternative name you can show it here to improve visibility in searches Long name - If your facility has a long name, you can show it here to improve visibility in searches Floor - If your facility does not fill an entire building Suite - If your facility does not fill an entire building CLLI - this is a location code used in parts of the US telecommunications industry and is most useful to facilities located in the USA Notes - this field, which supports Markdown , can be used to describe the characteristics of your facility that would be most useful to PeeringDB users You can look at the information shared by other facility managers to work out what your organization should be sharing. Database Records to Create User The org is the parent for the facility but you will need to start the process by creating a user account. If you use a role account for a PeeringDB user you should update the password when people who had access to the role account leave your organization. If you use a ticketing system, please make sure it does not auto-respond in a way that generates a slew of new tickets. Org The org object is your organization\u2019s core record in PeeringDB. All it needs is an organization name but you can add extra value by including information about where your organization is located. You could specify as little as a country name or as much as a full postal address. Your org object will be assigned a numeric identifier, called its id . This is what will be referenced by any child facility object. Facility Once you have created your organization you may add the facility object. You do this by using the Add Facility tab in the \u201cManage\u201d menu below your organization. Next Steps This short document describes the first steps for getting set up in PeeringDB. Once you have established your presence you should consider sharing information that would be helpful to potential new participants. Things to consider sharing: Encourage the networks and Internet Exchanges to also register with PeeringDB, and to indicate their presence in your facility. Thus making their presence visible to others and so increasing the possibility of interconnection with other networks.

This is largely policed by the community and has been very effective since PeeringDB was launched. Why should I add my network? Almost one-third of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) register their interconnection data in the PeeringDB database. That means, by using PeeringDB and adding your own interconnection data, you\u2019ll be able to confidently find information about networks looking to interconnect, where and how to connect with them, and they\u2019ll be able to find the same information about your network. Since the database is user-maintained and validated by our volunteers, you can trust that the information is accurate and up-to-date. This data will help you to accelerate the process of finding and connecting with other networks while supporting a faster and more decisive deployment of your own network expansion and development plans. Many networks are building automation that relies on PeeringDB. If you don't have an up to date PeeringDB record this might stop their automation configuring sessions.

If you need additional help getting started, please contact us at: . Information required You will need to create several database records, known as objects, to establish your presence in PeeringDB. Database objects organize relevant information and document the connections making your network attractive to potential peers. Most information is optional but the less you share the less likely your network will benefit from listing itself in PeeringDB. You can create your entry with the minimum required data and add and update the information you share over time. To maximize the value of your entry in PeeringDB you\u2019ll probably want to include more than the minimum required information. This information is required: Company name AS number Contact information (mandatory for networks with a connection to an Internet Exchange) This information is not required but is useful: IRR information Network type Network operational area (so-called geographic scope) Some networks share additional information. You can look at the information shared by your peers and potential peers to work out what your network should be sharing. Database records to create Some objects have a notes field to share additional information. You can use Markdown formatting for the notes to make them more readable. User The org is the parent for the network but you will need to start the process by creating a user account. We recommend that you use an e-mail address that exists in the publicly available contact information for the network\u2019s ASN so that we can automatically validate your affiliation with the network. If you use a role account for a PeeringDB user you should update the password when people who had access to the role account leave your organization.

You could specify as little as a country name or as much as a full postal address. Your org object will be assigned a numeric identifier, called its id .

Brand names or other identifiers can be listed in the aka field. For example: name: Example Org Legal Entity aka: Example Superfast Networks, Example Reliable Hosting Permissions to grant Once you are up and running you can create POC (Point of Contact) objects for functional contacts with your network. Not all networks need all POCs. These are: Abuse Maintenance NOC Policy Public Relations Sales Technical The information for each type of contact is the same, with optional telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, and URLs. Visibility of the POC information can be different for each POC. Each of the POCs associated with your network can have different visibility permissions. The options are: Users (meaning that only other PeeringDB users can see the POC), and Public (meaning that the record is shown to anonymous users as well as authenticated users). Some organizations will want to make their Abuse, Public Relations, and/or Sales POCs Public but limit the visibility of other POCs to authenticated Users . If your network will be present at Public Peering Exchange Points you can grant them permission to add and modify entries for your network via their ixp_member data . You grant permission using the \u201cAllow IXP Update\u201d box, which will show when you add a Public Peering Exchange Point. Next steps This short document describes the first steps for getting set up in PeeringDB. Once you have established your presence you should consider sharing information with current and potential peers about your network(s). Things to consider sharing: We recommend you include the name of your AS-SET or ROUTE-SET if you have multiple net objects. Edit your network object to provide information about your routing policy, traffic ratios and more. What is the maximum number of IPv4 and/or IPv6 prefixes should peers expect to see advertised by your network? You can use the info_prefixes4 and info_prefixes6 with integer values to share this information. How much traffic crosses your network and in which direction? You can share this information using the info_traffic and info_ratio attributes in your net object. You can enter numbers or pre-defined ranges for both attributes. Do you have a peering policy?

You only need a PeeringDB user account if you want to do one of three things: Access contact information Create, update, or delete entries in PeeringDB Use PeeringDB to login to external services, using the PeeringDB OAuth service . If you just want to look up information about networks, exchanges, or facilities in PeeringDB, you can do that without an account using the web interface or the API . How can I manage permissions for users affiliated with my organization? Unless you want your users to manage parts of the data your organization publishes, they don\u2019t need to be affiliated with your organization. When you allow a user account to affiliate with your organization, you can delegate some permissions to it. You can delegate them permissions related to exchanges, facilities, and networks. For each type of entry you can delegate permissions to create, update, or delete. The table below shows an example for an affiliated user who has only been delegated permission to update the organization\u2019s net object. Create Update Delete Exchanges No No No Facilities No No No Networks No Yes No Admin users for an organization can do all these things and can delegate granular permissions to users based on the needs of their organization. How do I give permissions to a user who is already affiliated with other organizations? User accounts can be associated with multiple organizations. For instance, a consultant could be associated with each of their client\u2019s organizations. Similarly, a large organization composed of several operating companies could have a different organization for each operating company in PeeringDB and have some users affiliated with those instead of trying to centralize control. The user just needs to request affiliation with each organization whose data they will be updating in PeeringDB. How do I authenticate at external services using my PeeringDB account? If your organization operates a network and has the Autonomous System registered with PeeringDB, your users can use their PeeringDB accounts to authenticate at external services that have enabled PeeringDB\u2019s OAuth service.

Restrict email domains You can set a policy that only allows users to affiliate when their email address uses a specific domain. You can set a list of the domains your organization allows. If users do not meet the policy when it is configured they will not lose their affiliation. You will be notified so you can manage the change with your users. A user with multiple email addresses associated with their account only needs one address to match. For instance, if the policy requires users to have an example.com address and the user has both an example.com and an example.net address, the user can affiliate. Periodic validation of user\u2019s contact information You can require users to validate the contact information for their PeeringDB user account. You set the time after which the validation process will be run. The default is 1 year but you can set it as short as 1 week. This options is managed in the same control panel shown in the image above. When an unvalidated user tries to login a link will be sent to their email address. They will need to go to that web page to validate their contact information before they can login. Some users are affiliated with multiple organizations. When this is the case, the link will be sent to the most suitable address for that organization. When a user is affiliated with multiple organizations, those organizations can set different revalidation periods. The user\u2019s affiliation is suspended at the end of the validation counter only for that organization. For example, Alice is affiliated to Example Networks and Example Facilities. Example Networks requires users to validate after 90 days but Example Facilities requires users to revalidate after a year. If Alice validates to both organizations on 1 January, she will remain a valid user for Example Facilities until the end of the year but will need to validate for Example Networks on 1 April. Multiple email addresses per user Users may have multiple email addresses associated with their account. They must select one address as the primary address and this will be used for notifications. This is managed in each user's own profile, which is located in the hamburger menu by the user's username. Each email address can only be associated with one user.

Users have installed it on several Linux distributions, macOS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux. It will give you a local version of PeeringDB\u2019s SQL database. Unlike the PeeringDB API, the SQL data structure might change without notice. Please do not build tools that make SQL queries. We suggest using our library to make API calls on your local cache. We maintain the library and commit to maintaining the API functionality, even if the underlying database structure changes. Please let us know if you find a query that is only possible with SQL and not via the API. Either create an issue in GitHub , or send a mail describing the problems to support@peeringdb.com . PeeringDB credentials You only need a PeeringDB account if you want to synchronize the contact information to your peeringdb-py cache. If you want to synchronize the whole database, including the contact data, you will need an API Key. If you are installing peeringdb-py for organizational use you should use an organizational API Key. You can use an API Key tied to a user account for personal use. We have a HOWTO guide for API Keys . Software requirements You must ensure these these packages are installed to install and use peeringdb-py : - git - pip - python - virtualenv You will also need to have a database installed. The configuration defaults to using SQLite. Database peeringdb-py \u2019s defaults to an SQLite3 database. You can choose to use a different database. If you want to do this you must adjust the database engine statement in the config.yaml , which is placed in your .peeringdb/config.yaml , which sits in your home directory.

The database facilitates global network connections at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and it serves as a starting point for interconnection decisions. This online database is a non-profit, community-driven effort that encourages the exchange of Peering-related information and is totally managed and maintained by volunteers. It's a tool for the Internet's growth and enhancement. Why use PeeringDB to search for networks, exchange and data centers? There are a number of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) known as networks that use PeeringDB to store their interconnection information. Using PeeringDB, you'll be able to access and search for information about other networks requesting interconnection. If you contribute your own data to PeeringDB then it's also possible for them to find out about your own network details. There is no need to create an account in order to use the basic search functionality. But if you want to access private contact information and use advanced search features, like radius search, you'll need to sign up for an account. By using PeeringDB, data centers referred to as facilities and exchanges (IXPs) can increase their visibility to potential and existing customers by adding or updating their records in the database, making it significantly easier for networks to access information about their service. How to search for exchanges, facilities and networks in PeeringDB On the front page of PeeringDB, you will see a simple search box which you can use to search for exchanges, facilities and networks that are on PeeringDB by simply entering the desired name on the search. Let\u2019s demonstrate with some examples to see how this works. Networks For this example, we have this network KENET which is a non-profit operator for education and research and we want to search for it on PeeringDB. There are two ways to search for networks in PeeringDB: Name search You can search for networks by using the name of the networks by: - Entering the name of the network as seen below - From the search result, under the Networks section, locate the network you have searched - It would be visible if it is in the PeeringDB database ASN search You can search for networks using their ASN by: - Entering the name of the network as seen below, for the example below the ASN is (36914) - From the search result, under the Networks section, locate the network you have searched Note : Either of the two methods will get the same search results. Exchanges For this example, let\u2019s consider this exchange UNY-IX which is an open Internet exchange located in Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta. To search for an exchange: - Enter the name of the exchange as shown below - From the search result, under the exchanges section, locate the exchange you have searched Facilities Data centers are also referred to as facilities. For this example, let\u2019s consider this university University of Oslo which is an institution in Oslo. To search for a facility: - Enter the name of the data center or facility as shown below - From the search result, under the facilities section, locate the facility or data center you have searched How to use the search in PeeringDB extension The PeeringDB search extension is a free to use Google Chrome extension with which you can use to search for ASNs, networks, and exchanges in PeeringDB. To get started, go to the Chrome Web Store and download the extension, then enable it and add it to your extension bar. There are two ways to use the extension once it has been enabled: Using the Extension Bar Icon : Click the icon and type your search term into the box. The search will open in a new tab with the search result. Below is the result: Using the Context Menu : Right-click on any text on a page and select \"Search in PeeringDB\". The search will open in a new tab with the search result. Below is the result: If the query or highlighted text contains a number, the extension will attempt to find an ASN. How to search based on a partial name You can search based on a partial name. When an organization, network, facility or exchange name has two parts, you can search for just the first or second part and then select from all the organizations that share that name. This makes it easier to find the organization you want. This can also be helpful in a situation where you can not remember the name of the organization in full. In the example below, we want to search for \u201cinternet archive\u201d. We will search for it with a single part and not with the full name. In the search box, input \u201carchive''. This brings out a search result that have similar parts in their names. You can now search through the results to find the what you want. What is an advanced search? Advanced search in PeeringDB lets you explicitly filter a search location, network presence, service level and a wide range of other features. You get the results you\u2019re looking for and can export them in structured data formats (JSON or CSV), so you can import the data into tools that will help you make decisions. Note : You need to be logged in to PeeringDB in order to use some of the advanced search features, including the radius search. Let\u2019s take a look at this example below to demonstrate how advanced search works. We are going to search for an exchange within a particular region. On the front page of PeeringDB you will see the Advanced Search box which you can use to search for exchanges, facilities and networks that are in PeeringDB. Click on the Advanced Search link. This takes you to the advanced search landing page. The search page shows the exchanges, networks, facilities and organizations tabs. Go to the Exchanges tab, in the country field select a country of your choice by scrolling through the different options. On the right hand side, in the Network Presence field, enter the name of the network. You can follow the example shown below and add KENET. Click on the drop down list that appears as you input the network name. Click on Search. Scroll down to view information regarding the exchange that you searched for. Click on JSON or CSV to download the information in a structured format. Geographic search As new facilities are created in our database they will be linked to geographic coordinates. PeeringDB has improved search by changing the way it records data for location in its database. You can now search for facilities with a distance radius of a chosen coordinate. How to search for facilities within a given radius You can search for facilities within a given radius, using the Advanced Search interface. Users can search from a country and city, and select a radius in kilometers or miles. Of course, you can achieve the same results using the API or the web interface, which means you can integrate this feature into your own tools. Note : You need to be logged in to PeeringDB in order to search for facilities within a given radius. Login in or register an account on PeeringDB. On the front page of PeeringDB, click on the Advanced Search link. Go to the Facilities Tab and in the city/postal field add a city or postal of your choice. In the country field select a country of your choice. In the Within Distance field add a specified distance of your choice. On the right hand side of the page, click on search. Scroll down to view the information you searched for. The search result will bring up facilities which are in that country, city and state. You can download your information in a JSON or CSV format. Querying with the PeeringDB API Throughout this article up to this point, we have been talking on how to use PeeringDB to find information about potential peers, and then after peering has been arranged, using PeeringDB to obtain the peering details. The PeeringDB website is very helpful in these regards, but using the website still requires a lot of manual work. It\u2019s also possible to use the PeeringDB API to automate some parts of this. Why use the PeeringDB API? The PeeringDB API makes it easy to integrate PeeringDB in your environment. The PeeringDB database can be queried using a REST API. REST allows a client to request information from a server over HTTP or HTTPS. The server then returns the requested information in JSON format. Object types Each object has an associated shorthand tag you can use. Object types are not case sensitive and the output is an array. For example: https://www.peeringdb.com/api/OBJ . The endpoint is: /api/OBJ . Below are the categories of objects types (OBJ) in PeeringDB: - Basic Objects : org, fac, ix, net, poc - Derived Objects : ixlan, ixpfx, netixlan, netfac Basic objects Below is a description of what each of the object types mean and what information they return org : Root object for fac, ix, net, this holds information about an organization. fac : Describes a facility / colocation record, more useful information are in derived records netfac. ix : Describes an exchange, more useful information are in derived records ixlan, ixpfx and netixlan. net : Describes a network / ASN, more useful information are in netfac and netixlan. poc : Describes various role accounts (point of contact), this is currently only for net objects. as_set : Array of all AS-SETs corresponding to a network / ASN, this was introduced recently. Derived objects Below is a description of what each of the object types mean and what information they return. Ixlan : Describes the LAN of an ix, one ix may have multiple ixlan. This feature may go away in PeeringDB 3.0. ixpfx : Describes the IP range (IPv4 and IPv6) for an ixlan, one ixlan may have multiple ixpfx. netixlan : Describes the presence of a network at an exchange. netfac : Describes the presence of a network at a facility. Authentication Authentication is done through basic HTTP authorization. People who are accessing the API as a guest do not need any authentication. For example: curl -sG https://username:password@www.peeringdb.com/api/net/961 curl -u username:password https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net/961 Note : Access to contact information may be restricted if you are using the API as a guest without authentication. API usage is subject to query limits and these are set at a lower threshold for unauthenticated users. Making a request When making a request, the URL base is added with /api/ , followed by the object type and, if applicable, the object primary key (if applicable). For example: https://www.peeringdb.com/api/OBJ/id . If you want to select the output format, either use the Accept: HTTP header or use the extension type parameter: - Accept Header: Accept: application/json - Extension type: https://www.peeringdb.com/api/network/42.json Operations Using the GET operation you can retrieve information from the PeeringDB database. You can retrieve both a single object and multiple objects in an array. Let\u2019s look at each of them individually. Single object To retrieve a single object you need to use this URL: https://www.peeringdb.com/api/OBJ/ID with this endpoint GET: /api/OBJ/id . The ID is a unique identifier and should be added to the URL when retrieving a single object. Let\u2019s look at an example: - HTTP: GET /api/OBJ/38 where 38 is the ID - curl: curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -X GET https:// username : password @peeringdb.com/api/OBJ/38 There are optional parameters you can add to your URL: - str : which retrieves a comma separated list of field names - only matching fields will be returned in the data - int : which retrieves two nested sets and objects Nested sets and objects A nested set or object is any field ending in the suffix: set. For example: net_set will hold network objects. The naming schema of the field will always tell you which type of object the set is holding and will correspond with the object's endpoint on the API object_type _set . So a set called net_set will hold network objects (API endpoint /net). Note : unlike GET multiple, depth here will also expand single relationships in addition to sets. So net_id would get expanded into a network object. Unexpanded { ... net_id : 1 } Expanded { ... net_id : 1 net : { ... network object ... } } Depth - 0: don't expand anything (default) - 1: expand all first level sets to ids - 2: expand all first level sets to objects Multiple objects To retrieve a single object you need to use this URL: https://www.peeringdb.com/api/OBJ/ with this endpoint GET: /api/OBJ/ . Let\u2019s look at an example: - HTTP: GET /api/OBJ/ which is the endpoint - curl: curl -X GET https:// username : password @www.peeringdb.com/api/OBJ There are optional parameters you can add to your URL: - limit : int limits rows in the result set - skip : int skips n rows in the result set - depth : int nested sets will be loaded (slow) - fields : str comma separated list of field names - only matching fields will be returned in the data - since : int retrieve all objects updated since specified time (unix timestamp, seconds) - [field_name] : int|string queries for fields with matching value Real world use cases We will show you different use cases on how to use the PeeringDB API. How do I query by ASN? To query the ASN 42 using PeeringDB API, you will need to use this URL: GET https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net?asn=42 , where asn=42 is the query parameter. Using curl Use this curl example to get this specific network. Copy and paste the following to your command line interface: curl GET https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net?asn=42 . Using Python To make use of this Python code, first, you\u2019ll have to first install Python if you don\u2019t have it installed. Then, install pip and requests . After that create a Python file and copy and paste the following code. import requests r = requests.get('https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net?asn=42') print(r.text) with open('output.csv', 'w+') as f: f.write(r.text) From the above code, we make a request to the API using the request module and print out the response which would be in a JSON format. However, reading a JSON file can be quite hectic and tasking so we convert the JSON file to a CSV file. Our CSV file will open in output.csv. Using jq You can use jq to make a request to your API and get your output in a CSV format. First, you need to install Jq . Next, we use this curl command to prepare our JSON file. Change to a directory and copy and paste this code on your terminal: curl https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net?asn=42 test.json . This creates a new file named test.json. To convert the JSON input file to the CSV format, copy and paste the following command: jq -r '(.data[0] | keys_unsorted), (.data[] | to_entries | map(.value))|@csv' test.json Using an online converter Alternatively you can use an online tool such as https://www.convertcsv.com/json-to-csv.htm to convert the raw JSON file to CSV. Note : For the purpose of this article we will focus on the curl method but you can conveniently try out the other proposed methods. How to get all the objects owned by https://www.peeringdb.com/net/961 and convert the data to CSV? To get all the objects owned by this https://www.peeringdb.com/net/961 using the PeeringDB API. Copy and paste the following to your command line interface: curl GET https://www.peeringdb.com/net/961 . I want the list of networks and their 'type' peering at MICE in Minneapolis. To get the list of networks and their type peering at Mice in Minneapolis, copy and paste the following command in your terminal: curl -s -X GET https://www.peeringdb.com/api/net?ix=446 __in=Minneapolis | jq '.data[] . How to find all the exchanges where my organization has a presence? Use this curl example. Copy and paste the following to your command line interface: curl -s -X GET https://www.peeringdb.com/api/netixlan\\?ixlan_id=62 | jq '.data[]' .","title":"HOWTO: Get Started with Search in PeeringDB"},{"location":"howto/search/#howto-get-started-with-search-in-peeringdb","text":"","title":"HOWTO: Get Started with Search in PeeringDB"},{"location":"howto/search/#introduction-to-peeringdb","text":"PeeringDB is a publicly available network database that is the go-to location for interconnection data.

Many networks using private address space ( RFC 1918 ) leak the reverse DNS lookups instead of running a local DNS server to respond to them. To stop this traffic from overwhelming root nameservers, volunteers run AS112 nameservers , which provide authoritative, local answers. What is PeeringDB? PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions. The database is a non-profit, community-driven initiative run and promoted by volunteers. It is a public tool for the growth and good of the Internet. Join the community and support the continued development of the Internet. How Does PeeringDB Visibility Help? The listing for AS112 in PeeringDB contains the peering LAN IP addresses of the routers for the network. This can be used as a source of configuration information for the peering routers of other networks at the same IXP. What you need to do IXPs sharing technical information using the IX-F Member Export Schema When an IXP shares technical information about its infrastructure using the IX-F Member Export Schema the existence of the AS112 node, and its peering LAN address, will automatically be populated in PeeringDB. You, as the operators of the node do not need to do anything. This is because AS112 has enabled the option to allow the IXPs' IX-F data to automatically populate its entry in PeeringDB. IXPs not sharing technical information using the IX-F Member Export Schema If your IXP does not share technical information about its infrastructure using the IX-F Member Export Schema you can ask them to do so.

All networks with route collectors have now been properly classified. #665 Drop ixlan name from displaying at \"Peers at this Exchange Point\" Simplified the user interface by removing the name of the ixlan as there is now just one ixlan per exchange point. #775 Misleading tooltip of prefix limit fields NO Improved the user interface with better language in the tooltip. The distinction between maximum prefix length and maximum number of prefixes should now be clearer. #814 Suppress RDAP call for contact data/handles for NIC.br // AUTOTOOL Internal tool change. This change suppresses calls for contact data over RDAP because NIC.br is no longer allowed to provide direct calls for personal data. #803 Searching for a user in /cp/peeringdb_server/userorgaffiliationrequest results in 500 Internal tool change. Fixed an error that could return a 500 error on some searches. #688 Automate creation of Release Notes Internal tool change.

Display fields in an explicit order. #850 IX-F Importer: Repeated emails are being generated for things already emailed Internal procedure optimisation. A series of improvements to the IX-F importer tool. These changes are all related to improving notifications about data quality that were developed by the Data Ownership Task Force. #856 IX-F Importer: Make hyperlinks clickable when creating DeskPRO tickets See #850. #857 IX-F Importer: intermittent issue with speed validation See #850. #858 IX-F Importer: Make pdb_deskpro_publish command ignore importer tickets See #850. #859 IX-F Importer: ERROR: 'IXFMemberData' object has no attribute 'ixf_log_entry' See #850. #860 IX-F Importer Blocker: \"Days until DeskPRO ticket is created\" should now be ignored/removed, such that no ticket or emails happen after a delay See #850. Release 2.23.0 Beta Announcement Date: 30 September, 2020 Release Date: 7 October, 2020 GitHub Issue Summary #833 - IX-F Importer: Add failed email resending Implement re-send mechanic for emails that could not be sent (indicated by a sent value of null). When re-sending an email add a note to the email stating \"This email could not be delivered initially and may contain stale information\". Add a field to the admin-com import emails table to show this note as well. Update sent if send is successful #832 - IX-F Importer: suggested update when it should be add + remove In some edge cases a deletion will end up as a requirement incorrectly to a legitimate new entry still. See #770 #816 #831 - [prod] IX-F importer: NameError: name 'EmailMultiAlternatives' is not defined Fixes broken email function of ix-f importer #826 - Make technical poc mandatory when adding a netixlan Upon creating a netixlan object check that net has at least one ( Technical , NOC , Policy ) poc and that the poc has an e-mail address. If not ask them to create one first. Visibility of at least one ( Technical , NOC , Policy ) poc has to be \"Users\" resp. \"Public\" #825 - [beta] IX-F importer: Make Importer return non-zero when there is an error that Ops should see Improvements to ix-f importer that allow for easier notification and tracking of errors for the Ops team #824 - IX-F Preview - shows the consolidated delete operation when it shouldn't Simplified the UI for consolidated modifications to improve user understanding #759 - Describe the 'never-via-routeservers' flag Add tooltip for never-via-routeservers option: \"Indicates if this network will announce its routes via route servers or not\" #571 - Facility registration tool adds identifier Fixes small UI bug in facility registration tool used by the Admin Committee #481 - Add min_speed and max_speed to ixlan Based on the discussion in #475 adds a new global setting that limits netixlan speed values now. It's not a property on the ixlan anymore. #371 - Clean up users in verification queue A tool to delete user entries older than 90 days from the so-called verification queue and run it on a regular schedule #370 - Make Website mandatory for suggesting a facility Website is now mandatory when suggesting a facility but zipcode only mandatory for countries that have zipcodes #321 - Typos in locale Fixes a number of typographical errors Release 2.22.0 Beta Announcement Date: 15 July, 2020 Release Date: 26 August, 2020 GitHub Issue Summary #249 - Add the IX-F Member Export URL to the ixlan API endpoint There are two new fields in the ixlan section resp. the ixlan object, called ixf_ixp_member_list_url and ixf_ixp_member_list_url_visible. The first one contains the URL to the IX-F import file while the second governs the visibility of the URL. Values are the same as for the poc object, namely \"Public\", \"Users\" and \"Private\", defaulting to \"Private\" (i.e. or users who are members of the org). #268 - Database: unique constraints This issue fixes internal DB behaviour. #358 - Lock ASN once the record is created Once a network has been created, the field asn is made read-only. As the ASN is unique there is no reason to change it. Making the field read-only is to prevent unwanted side effects. #431 - Null 'rencode' from facility Null out all values for legacy unused rencode field, and make it read only to prepare for removal in PDB v3 [#625] (https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/625). #600 - Visibility for \"Allow IXP update\" switch A new field is added to the API net object, called allow_ixp_update. Furthermore, a line is added in global stats in the footer with a count (called \"Automated Networks\") of the networks which have \"Allow IXP Update\" enabled. #649 - Possible for 'ok' ixpfx to exist in 'pending' ixlan This issue fixes an internal bug. #683 - Add net_count_ixf field to ix object A field is added to the API object ix, called net_count_ixf, which indicates the number of net objects the exchange has in their IX-F JSON if they provide one. Otherwise, the value is null. #696 - Lock some objects from being deleted by the owner To protect operational data objects fac, ix, ixlan and org are prevented from being deleted as long as there are other objects related to it. First, these objects must be deleted before the object itself can be deleted. The attempt to delete such a protected object gives an error message and also opens a ticket with the PeeringDB support. #697 - Creating, changing, and deleting a netixlan object We completely re-implemented the way a connection to an exchange is handled. This new procedure allows both for a safe heads up a network can give to their peers as well as a safe way for exchanges to get rid of stale entries. Moreover, it allows networks to easily acknowledge new entries at exchanges which use the IX-F importer feature. See also the webinar for detailed information on this new procedure. Release 2.21.0 Beta Announcement Date: 24 June, 2020 Release Date: 1 July, 2020 GitHub Issue Summary #72 - Enable sort and reverse sort of IP column in IX display Sort and reverse sort of IP column in IX display are added. Sort of the IP addresses in the expected natural order. The IPv4 address is the primary sort key. The IPv6 address is the secondary key. #121 - missing delete button for organizations New feature. An admin user is able to delete an org if it has no live objects under it. #290 - Offer 2FA 2FA is offered now. The implementation includes optional 2FA using TOTP is offered there is a knob in the user profile to enable and set it up email recovery is added using the verified user email address an icon is added in the org admin section to denote to org admins if users have 2FA enabled #352 - Mark IXP peering LAN as bogon Allow IXP to tag their LAN prefixes as bogons. In general, LAN prefixes should not be visible in the DFZ. If it should be visible, IXPs are able to debogonise them #356 - Sorting by clicking table headers should use local-compare Bugfix. Sorting now honours locale-sorting #519 - Make spelling of traffic levels consistent This is a bug fix and a minor improvement. Spelling is made consistent and traffic levels up to 100+Tbps are added. #526 - Show \"Last Updated\" fields on fac, ix, org records A \"Last Updated\" field is visible now for fac, ix, and org objects #537 - Posting https://www.peeringdb.com onto social media doesn't select a good preview image Add opengraph image for page preview. #566 - Should deleted personal data be accessable through the API? If a poc object is deleted it is made immediately non-gettable via the API, too. In case the corresponding net object was deleted unintentionally the object is still kept in the DB. After 30 days it will be hard-deleted. #569 - Don't return any POC data with status=deleted POC objects do have a visibility scope. If a POC record is deleted it should not be able to retrieve it at all, even if visibility had been set to \"public\" before. The data will still be kept internally for 30 days for rollback if the deletion happened unintentionally. After 30 days the record will be hard-deleted. #580 - Add a clear error message, when user tries to re-add a previously deleted facility Bug fix for an unclear behaviour. If a connection from a network to a facility was deleted the user was unable to re-add this connection by themselves and an unclear error message was given. Now, the user is able to re-add the connection. #618 - Support alternative direction of writing, e.g. Arabic For right-to-left written languages, the entire layout of the PeeringDB website has to be flipped around. #644 - Undeleting an ixlan with an emtpy IPv4 XOR IPv6 field throws a silly error Bugfix for the Admin Committee UI. An empty field was considered to be a legit non-null value and the system hence enforced uniqueness #650 - Add pointer from API docs to tutorial A URL is added from the API documentation website to the PeeringDB tutorials #654 - Add pointer from API docs to tutorial Bugfix for the Admin Committee UI. #663 - change default encoding of API calls to 'utf-8' The output of API calls will change from content-type: application/json; charset=iso-8859-1 to content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8 #664 - Selection should only present undeleted objects Admin Committee only related.

The first one contains the URL to the IX-F import file while the second governs the visibility of the URL. Values are the same as for the poc object, namely \"Public\", \"Users\" and \"Private\", defaulting to \"Private\" (i.e. or users who are members of the org). #268 - Database: unique constraints This issue fixes internal DB behaviour. #358 - Lock ASN once the record is created Once a network has been created, the field asn is made read-only. As the ASN is unique there is no reason to change it. Making the field read-only is to prevent unwanted side effects. #431 - Null 'rencode' from facility Null out all values for legacy unused rencode field, and make it read only to prepare for removal in PDB v3 [#625] (https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/625). #600 - Visibility for \"Allow IXP update\" switch A new field is added to the API net object, called allow_ixp_update.

Otherwise, the value is null. #696 - Lock some objects from being deleted by the owner To protect operational data objects fac, ix, ixlan and org are prevented from being deleted as long as there are other objects related to it. First, these objects must be deleted before the object itself can be deleted. The attempt to delete such a protected object gives an error message and also opens a ticket with the PeeringDB support. #697 - Creating, changing, and deleting a netixlan object We completely re-implemented the way a connection to an exchange is handled. This new procedure allows both for a safe heads up a network can give to their peers as well as a safe way for exchanges to get rid of stale entries. Moreover, it allows networks to easily acknowledge new entries at exchanges which use the IX-F importer feature.

If a poc object is deleted it is made immediately non-gettable via the API, too. In case the corresponding net object was deleted unintentionally the object is still kept in the DB. After 30 days it will be hard-deleted. #569 - Don't return any POC data with status=deleted POC objects do have a visibility scope. If a POC record is deleted it should not be able to retrieve it at all, even if visibility had been set to \"public\" before. The data will still be kept internally for 30 days for rollback if the deletion happened unintentionally. After 30 days the record will be hard-deleted. #580 - Add a clear error message, when user tries to re-add a previously deleted facility Bug fix for an unclear behaviour.

And from a peering partner pov this is ok as it doesn't matter whether these addresses are on the same interface or even same router. However, IX-F JSON differentiates. For the time being, the importer combines IPv4 and IPv6 if both are set to an operational status in the IX-F JSON. #846 IX-F importer: if ixf_ixp_member_list_url is null then ixf_ixp_import_enabled can't be true Apply logic to the meaning of ixf_ixp_member_list_url . i.e. only allow ixf_ixp_import_enabled to be set to true if a URL is specified. #875 \"IXF-Importer: improved handling of how contacts are joined into direct conflict resolution deskpro tickets\" Resolved an issue where responses to automatically generated Deskpro tickets were routed to the wrong ticket. #878 IXF-Importer: reorder of email content This is mainly an internal improvement. And fixes also not disclosing private IXP information to the public. #882 IXF-Importer: don't abort when there is nothing to import If there is nothing to import from an IX-F JSON don't abort with an error message. #893 IX-F Importer: history of changes per ixlan netixlan Fixed bug related to the logging of importer changes. #896 IX-F Importer: Bogus output of \"Preview\" tool Fixed a bug in the preview tool, where invalid member type ignored messages weren't filtered for the network viewing the preview. #888 Type issue when overriding settings through environment variables for numeric types Fixed a bug and now ensure that overrides are coerced to the correct expected type. #872 Update dependencies Updated container to python 3.9 and addressed all dependencies. #694 add syntactic sugar for entering port speeds Simplifies the UI for editing port speeds to make it more human friendly. #717 Loading time issue /cp facility view Fixed slow load or timeouts for loading data for some facilities #837 Provide a friendlier explanation when entering / changing a phone number Provides a tooltip to help people enter E.164 formatted telephone numbers. #541 When looking at a network record, show last updated ix - net or fac - net date Improved information about when records were last updated.","title":"2021 Release Notes"},{"location":"release_notes/release_notes_2021/#2021-release-notes","text":"The release notes list the GitHub issues and a summary of what has changed in PeeringDB software releases.

A call for participation to the task Force was made on September 10th, 2019. Data Ownership Task Force discussions are archived and can be found at: https://lists.peeringdb.com/pipermail/dataownership-tf/ This webpage is where the work of Data Ownership Task Force will be documented, including meeting minutes, draft documents etc. as their work progresses. In April 2020, the Task Force completed its work and published the resulting PeeringDB Data Ownership Policy Document after few cycles of a Review Phase and a final Last Call over a draft document circulated on their mailing list. (Please see the mailing list archives linked above.) The resulting document can be found at: https://docs.peeringdb.com/gov/misc/2020-04-06_PeeringDB_Data_Ownership_Policy_Document_v1.0.pdf Scope The Data Ownership Task Force is established to discuss and agree on who owns the data tokens and/or objects in PeeringDB. Their agreements, findings, and any sort of recommendations will be documented in a Policy Document as a direct outcome of the Task Force. This Policy Document will include a clear description of each data element and the relation between each other, as well as who should be allowed to create, update, and delete them. The Task Force is estimated to conclude its work within about 6 months from its inception, which was September 2019. This time frame will be extended if the Task Force needs more time to conclude its work. The resulting Policy Document will be announced and shared with the PeeringDB Community. After publishing the Policy Document, the Task Force ended.
